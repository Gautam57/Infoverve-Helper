To create a workflow that uses the 'Execute API' to get a response, creates a data source from it, and then performs calculations on that data, you can follow these steps:

Execute API and Create Data Source:
First, you would use the 'Execute API' to retrieve data from an external source.
Once you have the response, you can create a data source within Infoveave using the data obtained from the API. This involves configuring a connection to the API and defining the structure of the data source.
Perform Calculations:
After creating the data source, you can use Infoveave's calculation features to perform various operations on the data.
This might involve using calculated fields to create new metrics, applying aggregations to summarize data, or using formulas to perform complex calculations.
For more detailed instructions, you can refer to the documentation on creating data sources and performing calculations in Infoveave.
