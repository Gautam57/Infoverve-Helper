    "content": "Introducing Automation | Infoveave Help\nSkip to content\nIntroducing Automation\nIn today’s data-centric environment, the need for efficient data handling and expedited decision-making is crucial for organizations. Infoveave’s Automation module addresses this demand by providing a versatile platform for designing, building, and deploying automated solutions that streamline data-related processes. This powerful module empowers users to significantly reduce manual effort, connect disparate data sources, and ultimately focus on higher-value strategic activities, driving increased operational efficiency and improved business outcomes.\nInfoveave’s Automation module offers two key capabilities - Workflow Automation and Web Automation. While both aim to automate tasks, they approach it from different angles and serve distinct purposes.\nWorkflow Automation\n, at its core, revolves around orchestrating a series of connected\nActivities\n. These activities, each representing a specific action like data extraction, transformation, validation, report generation - are linked together to form a\nWorkflow\n. Infoveave provides a visual, no-code/low-code environment for building these workflows, making it accessible to users regardless of their coding expertise. Workflow Automation excels at automating data pipelines, generating scheduled reports, performing data quality checks, setting up alerts based on data conditions, and integrating Infoveave with other applications. It seamlessly integrates with a wide array of data sources, including spreadsheets, databases, cloud storage, and third-party applications, ensuring a unified view of critical business data. Workflows can be triggered on a schedule, based on specific events, or manually, providing flexibility to adapt to your specific needs.\nWeb Automation\n, on the other hand, focuses on mimicking human actions within web applications. It involves configuring a “chain of tasks” that simulate how operational users would interact with web applications, such as logging in, navigating menus, entering data, and extracting information. The captured data undergoes validation and transformation based on predefined business rules, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Using Web Automation, the system executes automated tasks, updates relevant systems, generates reports and alerts, freeing business users from routine, repetitive tasks and enabling them to focus on strategic initiatives.\nIn essence, Workflow Automation focuses on orchestrating data-centric tasks and integrating systems, while Web Automation focuses on automating human-like interactions with web applications. Both capabilities complement each other within Infoveave’s Automation module, providing a comprehensive solution for organizations who want to optimize their data workflows, improve efficiency, and drive better business outcomes.\nWhether you want to automate data entry and validation, provide timely alerts, streamline your billing process, or automate data integration for providing real-time insights, Infoveave’s Automation module offers the necessary tools to achieve them all."

It reads each row, extracts the array from the configured column(s), and flattens each array item into a new row while preserving all other fields.\nThis is useful when your data source (e.g., an API or a connector) provides one or more columns containing arrays of JSON objects, and you need to break them out into individual rows to support downstream activities like transformations, aggregations, or exports.\nExample\n:\nSuppose you’re fetching order data from an API where each order includes a column named\nItems\n, which holds a list of purchased items in JSON format. You can use Flatten JSON Array to break out each item into its own row, making it easier to join, filter, or summarize line items later.\nInput\nData\n– Required\nRequires tabular structured input where specific columns contain valid JSON arrays.\nOutput\nOutput Type\nFormat\nNotes\nData\nTabular\nEach JSON object in the array is expanded into rows\nConfiguration Fields\nField Name\nDescription\nJSON Columns\nList of column names that contain JSON arrays to flatten.

This technique is useful in data preprocessing, reporting, and visualization, where numeric precision can be generalized for pattern discovery or grouping.\nBinning reduces complexity in datasets by segmenting a continuous range of values into a finite number of intervals. These intervals can be computed automatically using statistical rules or configured manually by specifying bin sizes and value ranges.\nUse this activity to:\nConvert continuous data into categorized groups\nPreprocess numerical columns for ML models or dashboards\nHighlight distribution patterns in reporting and visualization\nSimplify data when precision is unnecessary\nUse case\n:\nWhen analyzing customer age distributions, binning age into ranges such as “20–30”, “30–40”, and so on helps simplify reports.

Bin width is calculated using the interquartile range (IQR).\n-\nScott\n– Minimizes binning error by selecting optimal bin width based on the standard deviation of the dataset.\n-\nSquare Root\n– Uses a simple rule: number of bins =\n√n\n. Useful for quick approximations.\n-\nFixed Size Intervals\n– Manually specify bin width and range. The system will use this size to segment the data evenly. Requires\nMinimum Value\n,\nMaximum Value\n, and\nNumber Of Bins\nto be set.\n-\nCustom\n– Manually define specific ranges or thresholds for each bin.\nNumber Of Bins\nApplicable only for certain modes like\nFixed Size Intervals\n.

    "content": "Split http query | Infoveave Help\nSkip to content\nSplit http query\nDescription\nThe\nSplit HTTP Query\nactivity is used to extract and convert HTTP query strings embedded within URLs into structured, column-based data. This is particularly useful in cases where user input, system requests, or web-tracking data are passed as URL query parameters and stored in a single column.\nThis activity scans each value in the selected column to detect standard query string structures—those typically following a\n?\nin a URL, such as:\nhttps://domain.com/resource?key1=value1&key2=value2\nOnce detected, it parses each parameter (key-value pair) and creates new columns in the dataset, assigning values from the query string accordingly. This enables users to access and manipulate data like\nid\n,\nname\n,\ndepartment\n, etc., as individual fields rather than dealing with them inside an encoded string.\nExample Use Case\n:\nYou may have a dataset of employee links where each URL includes parameters like\n?id=E003&name=Carlos+Gomez&department=Engineering\n. This activity will extract\nE003\n,\nCarlos+Gomez\n, and\nEngineering\ninto separate columns named\nKey_id\n,\nKey_name\n, and\nKey_department\n, making the data easier to read, filter, or aggregate.\nInput\nType\nDescription\nData\nA dataset containing a column with HTTP URLs or raw query strings. The column must follow the typical format with key-value pairs separated by\n&\n.\nOutput\nType\nDescription\nTransformed Data\nA dataset where the selected column’s query parameters are expanded into individual columns.\nConfiguration Fields\nField Name\nDescription\nColumn Name\nThe column to be parsed. It should contain complete URLs or raw query strings containing key-value pairs separated by\n&\n. Only a single column can be selected.\nPrefix\nA custom prefix for the newly created columns. Each extracted key will be appended to this prefix. For example, a key\nid\nwith prefix\nKey_\nbecomes\nKey_id\n. This is useful to prevent naming collisions or to group similar fields.\nInclude Original\nDetermines whether the original input row is retained.\n-\nEnabled\n: Keeps all the original columns, including the raw HTTP query.\n-\nDisabled\n: Only shows the parsed query parameter columns.\nSample Input\nemployee_id\nname\nhttp_query\nE001\nJohn Doe\nhttps://company.com/employee?id=E001&name=John+Doe&department=Sales\nE002\nMarie Dupont\nhttps://company.com/employee?id=E002&name=Marie+Dupont&department=Marketing\nE003\nCarlos Gómez\nhttps://company.com/employee?id=E003&name=Carlos+Gómez&department=Engineering\nSample Configuration\nField\nValue\nColumn Name\nhttp_query\nPrefix\nKey_\nInclude Original\nEnabled\nSample Output\nemployee_id\nname\nhttp_query\nKey_id\nKey_name\nKey_department\nE001\nJohn Doe\nhttps://company.com/employee?id=E001&name=John+Doe&department=Sales\nE001\nJohn+Doe\nSales\nE002\nMarie Dupont\nhttps://company.com/employee?id=E002&name=Marie+Dupont&department=Marketing\nE002\nMarie+Dupont\nMarketing\nE003\nCarlos Gómez\nhttps://company.com/employee?id=E003&name=Carlos+Gómez&department=Engineering\nE003\nCarlos+Gómez\nEngineering"

You can choose to export a workflow with its complete configuration or as a reusable template. The import option allows you to upload existing workflows, making it easier to replicate and reuse processes without rebuilding them from scratch.\nExporting a Workflow\nWhen you export workflows, you get two options. You can either\nExport with configuration\nor\nExport as a template\n. Choose one of these options to download your file.\nExport with configuration\nExport with configuration keeps all the activity settings and details. When you use this option, nothing is removed — the entire workflow, including all configurations, is saved as it is. Use this when you want to copy or move the exact same workflow to another place.\nExport as template\nExport as template removes the activity configurations and only keeps the basic structure of the workflow. This is useful when you want to reuse the workflow layout or steps but set up new configurations later.\nImporting a Workflow\nThe\nImport workflow\noption allows you to bring in existing Workflows from external sources or other systems. When you select this option, you can upload Workflows that have already been created, so you do not have to rebuild them from scratch."

    "content": "Introducing Data Quality | Infoveave Help\nSkip to content\nIntroducing Data Quality\nData quality\nis a measure to check how accurate, complete, consistent, and useful data is for its purpose. Maintaining data quality guarantees high quality data that is reliable and helps businesses make better decisions. It ensures the data is correct, relevant, and ready to be used effectively for analysis, visualization and reporting.\nGood data quality helps businesses avoid mistakes, improves customer satisfaction, and facilitates efficient operations. On the other hand, poor data quality will lead to wrong conclusions, wasted resources, and poor outcomes.\nHigh-quality data is essential for organisations to meet a variety of business requirements, like regulatory compliance, maintaining financial accuracy, enhancing operational efficiency, achieving business growth, improving customer satisfaction among others.\nData Quality Dimensions\nAccuracy\nAccuracy ensures that the data reflects real-world information and is free of errors such as a customer’s address. Accurate data helps businesses generate dependable insights and enables better decisions.\nConsistency\nConsistency ensures that data is uniform across different sources. For example, a customer’s name must be the same in both the billing and CRM systems. Inconsistent data can create confusion and reduce trust.\nRelevancy\nRelevancy ensures that the data is appropriate and useful for the specified purpose. Essentially, it’s about having the right data for the right job. Relevant data can streamline operations, improve processes, and ultimately boost organizational performance.  For eg, for a company that wants to improve its marketing strategies, sales data related to customer demographics and purchase history is highly relevant.\nCompleteness\nCompleteness ensures all necessary information is present. For instance, a sales record should include details like the product, customer, and transaction amount. Missing information can make the data less useful and harder to analyze.\nValidity\nValidity checks whether the data follows the required rules and formats. For example, dates should be in “YYYY-MM-DD” format, and phone numbers should have the correct number of digits. Invalid data can cause errors and slow down processes.\nUniqueness\nUniqueness ensures that data is not duplicated. For example, a customer should only have one profile in the system. Duplicate records can be  misleading and lead to incorrect analysis.\nTimeliness\nTimeliness ensures that data is up-to-date and available real-time. For example, stock levels in an inventory system should reflect the current quantities. Outdated data can lead to poor decisions and missed opportunities.\nIntegrity\nIntegrity ensures that data relationships are accurate and well maintained across platforms by enforcing strict validation standards. For example, every order should have a valid customer ID that matches an entry in the customer database. Broken links in data can lead to incomplete or incorrect insights."

    "content": "Advanced Configuration | Infoveave Help\nSkip to content\nAdvanced Configuration\nCreating a View\nA\nView\nin Infoveave works as a custom tooltip that enhances data previews, transforming standard tooltips into dynamic insights. Unlike basic tooltips, a View allows you to use interactive widgets or visualizations for deeper analysis without leaving the page.\nHere is a step-by-step guide to help you configure a View for Infoboards:\nIn the\nInfoboard Setup\ntab, select the\nView\nfeature.\nClick\n+ Add view\n. A new view appears with the default name View 1.\nSelect the edit icon\nnext to the view name. This action takes you to the view designer interface.\nSet the width and height of the view designer screen.\nYou can also choose a background color for the view.\nConfiguring a View\nDrag and drop widgets onto the view designer.\nSelect the widget you want to configure.\nGo to the\nWidget Configuration\ntab to set the datasource, measures, and dimensions.\nConfigure fields like Datasource, value, axis, group, and date.\nUse the gear icon to format measures and dimensions if needed.\nAdd drill-down filters for deeper analysis if required.\nSet fixed filters for specific dimension and measure conditions if necessary.\nCustomizing a View\nSelect a widget on the designer canvas to customize it.\nGo to the\nWidget Customization\ntab and explore options for styling, labeling, and interactivity.\nEdit labels for axis name, value, or label.\nAdjust the font size, style, and alignment.\nSave changes to the widget’s appearance and behavior.\nClick\nSave\nand return to the Infoboard designer.\nLinking a View with an Infoboard\nSelect the widget on the Infoboard where you want to link the View.\nGo to the\nWidget Customization\ntab.\nFind the\nTooltip\nsection in the customization options.\nIn the\nBehaviour\nsetting, select\nView\nas the default option.\nIn the\nView\nsetting, choose the View you previously configured. All available Views appear in the\nView\nlist.\nClick\nSave\nto apply the linked View.\nHover over the selected widget to view the tooltip.\nConditional Expressions\nSetup Conditional Expressions In Infoboard\nInfoboard expressions are special rules that help you create dynamic and customized data visualizations by applying conditions to widget measures and dimension values. These expressions let you control how other widgets behave and appear based on conditions, making Infoboards more interactive and visually effective.\nExpression Syntax\nFunction(<Reference>,<Condition>) = Conditional Value\nWhere\n<Reference>\nis written as\n'Widget Name'[Measure Name]\nand\n<Condition>\nis written as\n[Dimension Name] = \"Dimension Value\"\nFunction\nrepresents a specific command used in data analysis.\n'Widget Name'\nuses single quotes to identify it as a string literal, typically for a widget name.\nMeasure Name\nis inside square brackets to show it’s a measure.\nDimension Name\nis inside square brackets to show it’s a dimension.\n\"Dimension Value\"\nis inside double quotes to specify a particular value.\nThe operator used in the expression defines the condition and is shown here for demonstration only.\nConditional Value\nrepresents the value that needs to be true for the condition to apply.\nConfiguring Expressions\nTo set up an expression in Infoveave, go to the desired Infoboard under\nInsights\n.\nClick\nConfiguration\nunder the\nInfoboard Setup\ntab for the selected Infoboard.\nSelect\nConfigure expressions\n. This opens the expression editor.\nThe editor shows any previously created expressions.\nClick\nAdd Expression\nto create a new one.\nEnter your expression using the correct syntax. Define measures, dimensions, filters, calculations, and conditions. Use functions and operators available in Infoveave.\nAfter writing the expression, set the\nAction\nthat should happen when the condition is met. Actions can include changing widget properties, showing messages, or triggering other widget interactions.\nTo add another Action, click the\nAdd rule +\nicon. You can add up to two actions for one expression.\nUse the radio button to set the widget’s\nVisibility\n. Choose between\nShow\nor\nHide\nbased on your condition.\nAssign the action to a specific Option Group. Common groups include\nGeneral, Title, Measure, and Label\n.\nIn the\nGeneral\ngroup, you can customize the widget’s appearance such as background color, borders, and shadows.\nIn the\nTitle\ngroup, you can change title settings like text, font size, and alignment.\nIn the\nImage\ngroup, you can manage image display including position and size.\nIn the\nLabel\ngroup, you control label display options like placement and size.\nDepending on your selected option group, customize the action. Here’s a breakdown of common action settings:\nGeneral\nBackground color\nlets you set the widget’s background.\nBorder\nallows you to configure the border’s color, width, and style.\nBorder Radius\nadjusts the corner roundness.\nShadow\nadds shadow effects.\nTheme\nlets you apply a visual theme.\nDecal\nadds decorative icons or elements.\nShow null values\ndetermines if empty data appears.\nTitle\nEnabled\ntoggles the title visibility.\nLabel\nsets the title text.\nWord wrap\nallows long text to continue on a new line.\nBackground color\nsets the background for the title.\nDecoration\nadds styling like underline or bold.\nFont family\nchooses the font style.\nFont size\ndefines how large the title text is.\nFont color\nsets the title text color.\nAlignment\nplaces the title within the widget.\nImage\nImage\nselects the image to display.\nPosition\nsets where the image appears.\nRepeat\ncontrols image tiling.\nSize\ndefines the image dimensions.\nClick the\nDelete\nicon to remove an expression or action.\nClick\nSave\nto save the expression.\nScenario\nYou manage an\nOrder Infoboard\nin Infoveave and want to trigger an action using an Expression. In this example, if the total number of online orders for Brazil is less than 150, a specific action should be triggered.\nContextual information\nYour dataset in the\nOrder Infoboard\ntracks\nOnline Orders\nusing the\n[Orders]\nmeasure and\n[Country]\ndimension, with the value “Brazil” as the focus.\nConfigure Expression\nHere’s how you define the expression\nSUMX('Online Orders'[Orders], [Country]=\"Brazil\") < 150\nThis checks if the sum of online orders in Brazil is below 150.\nTo trigger an action such as changing the background color of the\nOnline Orders\nwidget:\nChoose the\nGeneral\noption group because you’re adjusting the widget’s appearance.\nFrom the\nGeneral\noptions, select\nBackground color\nto apply a new background color when the condition is met.\nBy choosing the correct option group and action, you define how the widget responds to your condition.\nExpressions let you control how widgets behave and appear, helping your Infoboard share meaningful insights and highlight important information effectively.\nConfiguring a Color Palette\nThe Infoveave color palette lets you customize the appearance of your data. You can assign specific colors and icons to individual dimensions and measures. This improves readability and ensures consistent visual representation across all widgets in the Infoboard.\nFollow these steps to configure a color palette.\nOpen the Infoboard where you want to add a color palette and click on the\nEdit\noption.\nGo to the\nInfoboard Setup\ntab under the\nCustomize\npanel to access color palette options.\nUnder the\nConfiguration\noption, click on the\nConfigure color palette\nbutton. This opens a modal where you can define colors and icons for specific dimensions or measures. You can also view existing palettes.\nChoose the required Datasource from the available list.\nSelect either\nDimension\nor\nMeasure\nfrom the\nAdd by\noptions.\nPick the dimension or measure for which you want to define a color.\nSelect the specific item to which you want to assign a color and icon.\nSelect the desired icon from the Infoveave icon library.\nPick a color using the color picker or enter a color code.\nClick on the\nAdd\nbutton to assign the color and icon to the color palette.\nManaging Infoboard Layout\nInfoveave lets you arrange your Infoboard layout for optimal presentation. You can use drag-and-drop to move and resize widgets for desktop, tablet, or smartphone views.\nTo manage your Infoboard layout\nGo to the\nInsights\nmodule.\nChoose the Infoboard whose layout you want to update.\nClick the\nEdit\nicon\nto enter editing mode.\nIn the editing view, find layout settings under the\nInfoboard Setup\ntab in the\nView\nsection.\nSelect the layout type you need. Choose between Desktop, Mobile, or Print.\nMake the necessary layout adjustments.\nClick\nSave\nto save your updated Infoboard layout."

Unlike basic tooltips, a View allows you to use interactive widgets or visualizations for deeper analysis without leaving the page.\nHere is a step-by-step guide to help you configure a View for Infoboards:\nIn the\nInfoboard Setup\ntab, select the\nView\nfeature.\nClick\n+ Add view\n. A new view appears with the default name View 1.\nSelect the edit icon\nnext to the view name. This action takes you to the view designer interface.\nSet the width and height of the view designer screen.\nYou can also choose a background color for the view.\nConfiguring a View\nDrag and drop widgets onto the view designer.\nSelect the widget you want to configure.\nGo to the\nWidget Configuration\ntab to set the datasource, measures, and dimensions.\nConfigure fields like Datasource, value, axis, group, and date.\nUse the gear icon to format measures and dimensions if needed.\nAdd drill-down filters for deeper analysis if required.\nSet fixed filters for specific dimension and measure conditions if necessary.\nCustomizing a View\nSelect a widget on the designer canvas to customize it.\nGo to the\nWidget Customization\ntab and explore options for styling, labeling, and interactivity.\nEdit labels for axis name, value, or label.\nAdjust the font size, style, and alignment.\nSave changes to the widget’s appearance and behavior.\nClick\nSave\nand return to the Infoboard designer.\nLinking a View with an Infoboard\nSelect the widget on the Infoboard where you want to link the View.\nGo to the\nWidget Customization\ntab.\nFind the\nTooltip\nsection in the customization options.\nIn the\nBehaviour\nsetting, select\nView\nas the default option.\nIn the\nView\nsetting, choose the View you previously configured. All available Views appear in the\nView\nlist.\nClick\nSave\nto apply the linked View.\nHover over the selected widget to view the tooltip.\nConditional Expressions\nSetup Conditional Expressions In Infoboard\nInfoboard expressions are special rules that help you create dynamic and customized data visualizations by applying conditions to widget measures and dimension values. These expressions let you control how other widgets behave and appear based on conditions, making Infoboards more interactive and visually effective.\nExpression Syntax\nFunction(<Reference>,<Condition>) = Conditional Value\nWhere\n<Reference>\nis written as\n'Widget Name'[Measure Name]\nand\n<Condition>\nis written as\n[Dimension Name] = \"Dimension Value\"\nFunction\nrepresents a specific command used in data analysis.\n'Widget Name'\nuses single quotes to identify it as a string literal, typically for a widget name.\nMeasure Name\nis inside square brackets to show it’s a measure.\nDimension Name\nis inside square brackets to show it’s a dimension.\n\"Dimension Value\"\nis inside double quotes to specify a particular value.\nThe operator used in the expression defines the condition and is shown here for demonstration only.\nConditional Value\nrepresents the value that needs to be true for the condition to apply.\nConfiguring Expressions\nTo set up an expression in Infoveave, go to the desired Infoboard under\nInsights\n.\nClick\nConfiguration\nunder the\nInfoboard Setup\ntab for the selected Infoboard.\nSelect\nConfigure expressions\n. This opens the expression editor.\nThe editor shows any previously created expressions.\nClick\nAdd Expression\nto create a new one.\nEnter your expression using the correct syntax. Define measures, dimensions, filters, calculations, and conditions. Use functions and operators available in Infoveave.\nAfter writing the expression, set the\nAction\nthat should happen when the condition is met. Actions can include changing widget properties, showing messages, or triggering other widget interactions.\nTo add another Action, click the\nAdd rule +\nicon. You can add up to two actions for one expression.\nUse the radio button to set the widget’s\nVisibility\n. Choose between\nShow\nor\nHide\nbased on your condition.\nAssign the action to a specific Option Group. Common groups include\nGeneral, Title, Measure, and Label\n.\nIn the\nGeneral\ngroup, you can customize the widget’s appearance such as background color, borders, and shadows.\nIn the\nTitle\ngroup, you can change title settings like text, font size, and alignment.\nIn the\nImage\ngroup, you can manage image display including position and size.\nIn the\nLabel\ngroup, you control label display options like placement and size.\nDepending on your selected option group, customize the action. Here’s a breakdown of common action settings:\nGeneral\nBackground color\nlets you set the widget’s background.\nBorder\nallows you to configure the border’s color, width, and style.\nBorder Radius\nadjusts the corner roundness.\nShadow\nadds shadow effects.\nTheme\nlets you apply a visual theme.\nDecal\nadds decorative icons or elements.\nShow null values\ndetermines if empty data appears.\nTitle\nEnabled\ntoggles the title visibility.\nLabel\nsets the title text.\nWord wrap\nallows long text to continue on a new line.\nBackground color\nsets the background for the title.\nDecoration\nadds styling like underline or bold.\nFont family\nchooses the font style.\nFont size\ndefines how large the title text is.\nFont color\nsets the title text color.\nAlignment\nplaces the title within the widget.\nImage\nImage\nselects the image to display.\nPosition\nsets where the image appears.\nRepeat\ncontrols image tiling.\nSize\ndefines the image dimensions.\nClick the\nDelete\nicon to remove an expression or action.\nClick\nSave\nto save the expression.\nScenario\nYou manage an\nOrder Infoboard\nin Infoveave and want to trigger an action using an Expression. In this example, if the total number of online orders for Brazil is less than 150, a specific action should be triggered.\nContextual information\nYour dataset in the\nOrder Infoboard\ntracks\nOnline Orders\nusing the\n[Orders]\nmeasure and\n[Country]\ndimension, with the value “Brazil” as the focus.\nConfigure Expression\nHere’s how you define the expression\nSUMX('Online Orders'[Orders], [Country]=\"Brazil\") < 150\nThis checks if the sum of online orders in Brazil is below 150.\nTo trigger an action such as changing the background color of the\nOnline Orders\nwidget:\nChoose the\nGeneral\noption group because you’re adjusting the widget’s appearance.\nFrom the\nGeneral\noptions, select\nBackground color\nto apply a new background color when the condition is met.\nBy choosing the correct option group and action, you define how the widget responds to your condition.\nExpressions let you control how widgets behave and appear, helping your Infoboard share meaningful insights and highlight important information effectively.\nConfiguring a Color Palette\nThe Infoveave color palette lets you customize the appearance of your data. You can assign specific colors and icons to individual dimensions and measures. This improves readability and ensures consistent visual representation across all widgets in the Infoboard.\nFollow these steps to configure a color palette.\nOpen the Infoboard where you want to add a color palette and click on the\nEdit\noption.\nGo to the\nInfoboard Setup\ntab under the\nCustomize\npanel to access color palette options.\nUnder the\nConfiguration\noption, click on the\nConfigure color palette\nbutton. This opens a modal where you can define colors and icons for specific dimensions or measures. You can also view existing palettes.\nChoose the required Datasource from the available list.\nSelect either\nDimension\nor\nMeasure\nfrom the\nAdd by\noptions.\nPick the dimension or measure for which you want to define a color.\nSelect the specific item to which you want to assign a color and icon.\nSelect the desired icon from the Infoveave icon library.\nPick a color using the color picker or enter a color code.\nClick on the\nAdd\nbutton to assign the color and icon to the color palette.\nManaging Infoboard Layout\nInfoveave lets you arrange your Infoboard layout for optimal presentation. You can use drag-and-drop to move and resize widgets for desktop, tablet, or smartphone views.\nTo manage your Infoboard layout\nGo to the\nInsights\nmodule.\nChoose the Infoboard whose layout you want to update.\nClick the\nEdit\nicon\nto enter editing mode.\nIn the editing view, find layout settings under the\nInfoboard Setup\ntab in the\nView\nsection.\nSelect the layout type you need. Choose between Desktop, Mobile, or Print.\nMake the necessary layout adjustments.\nClick\nSave\nto save your updated Infoboard layout."

The\nAdd calculated column\nmodule will open.\nEnter a name for the calculated column.\nSelect the appropriate column type.\nEnter the required formula or JavaScript code. Use\n(@)\nto refer to a column from the source.\nClick on\nValidate\nto preview the new column.\nCheck the\nRecalculate on add\noption for the table to instantly validate the expression and add values to the new column. Enabling this checkbox avoids the need to reupload the data to populate the calculated column.\nClick on\nAdd column\nto finalize and add the calculated column to your data table.\nScenarios\nChange Column Format\nIn data analysis, it is often necessary to change the format of a column to meet specific requirements or conform to certain rules. With Infoveave, you can easily do this using calculated columns and custom JavaScript to transform data. In this tutorial, you learn how to add an alphabet as a prefix to numeric values in a column.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing sales information, including a\nCustomer ID\ncolumn with numeric values representing unique customer identifiers. In this example, you add the alphabet\nA\nto each\nCustomer ID\nvalue to create a new identifier format.\nJavaScript Code\nlet\ncustomerID\n= @\nCustomer\nID\n;\n// Get the value of the Customer ID column\nlet\nnewCustomerID\n=\n'\nA\n'\n+\ncustomerID\n.\ntoString\n();\n// Concatenate 'A' with the Customer ID and convert to string\nnewCustomerID\n;\n// Return the new Customer ID\nReplace Nulls\nDuring data preparation for analysis, you may encounter missing or null values that can impact the accuracy of your insights. Addressing these gaps is essential for meaningful analysis. Infoveave provides tools to efficiently handle such scenarios. In this tutorial, you explore how to replace null values with a specified text, such as\nNot available\n, using calculated columns in Infoveave.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing customer information where some fields may have missing values. Focus on the\nAge\ncolumn and replace null values with\nNot available\n.\nJavaScript Code\nlet\nage\n= @\nAge\n;\n// Replace 'Age' with the actual column name\nif\n(\nage\n===\nnull\n||\nage\n===\n\"\"\n) {\nage\n=\n\"\nNot available\n\"\n;\n// Replace null or empty values with \"Not available\"\n}\nage\n;\n// Return the modified value\nReplace Column Values\nYou may need to modify specific values in your dataset to reflect updated information or new business requirements. With Infoveave’s calculated columns feature, you can achieve this easily by applying custom JavaScript code to manipulate your data. In this tutorial, you learn how to replace specific values in a column. Use an example dataset where you update the dealer name\nSipes Group\nto\nNew Spkies\ndue to a recent company merger.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing dealer information where some fields may contain incorrect values. Focus on the\nDealer Name\ncolumn and replace\nSipes Group\nwith\nNew Spkies\n.\nJavaScript Code\nlet\ndealerName\n= @\nDealer\nName\n;\n// Access the value of the \"Dealer Name\" column\n// Check if the dealerName is \"Sipes Group\", replace with \"New Spkies\", else keep the original value\nif\n(\ndealerName\n===\n\"\nSipes Group\n\"\n) {\ndealerName\n=\n\"\nNew Spkies\n\"\n;\n}\ndealerName\n;\n// Return the modified value\nRemove Timestamps from Date Columns\nIn data analysis, it is common that the date columns contain timestamps. In certain cases, you may need to remove the time stamp analysis or visualization. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to remove timestamps from date columns using Infoveave’s calculated columns feature. We will use an example dataset containing order information with timestamps and show how to extract and format the date portion only.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing order information with timestamps in the “Order Date” column. We want to remove the timestamps and display only the date portion.\nJavaScript Code\nvar\ntime\n= @\nOrder\nDate\n;\nvar\nnewTime\n=\ntime\n?\ntime\n.\nsplit\n(\n\"\n\"\n)[\n0\n]\n:\nnew\nDate\n()\n.\ntoISOString\n()\n.\nsplit\n(\n\"\nT\n\"\n)[\n0\n];\nvar\nparts\n=\nnewTime\n.\nsplit\n(\n\"\n-\n\"\n);\nvar\nformattedDate\n=\nparts\n[\n2\n]\n+\n\"\n-\n\"\n+\nparts\n[\n1\n]\n+\n\"\n-\n\"\n+\nparts\n[\n0\n];\nformattedDate\n;\nAdd Conditional Filters\nFiltering data based on specific conditions is a common task in data analysis to focus on relevant subsets of data. With Infoveave, you can implement conditional filters using JavaScript code within calculated columns. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a conditional filter to select rows based on a specific condition. Use an example of filtering customers older than 30 years from the dataset.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing employee information with columns for\nEmployee Name\nand\nAge\n. You want to filter out employees who are older than 30 years.\nJavaScript Code\nvar\nage\n= @\nAge\n;\nif\n(\nage\n&&\nage\n<=\n30\n) {\ntrue\n;\n}\nelse\n{\nfalse\n;\n}"

    "content": "Calculated Columns | Infoveave Help\nSkip to content\nCalculated Columns\nCalculated columns in Infoveave allow you to create new data columns based on existing data. By using JavaScript, you can perform complex transformations and clean column values directly within Infoveave. This enables you to manipulate and refine your data to meet specific analysis requirements.\nConfiguring Calculated Columns\nHere is a step-by-step guide to configure calculated columns in Infoveave.\nOpen the required table in the\nDatasource Designer\n.\nChoose the data table where you want to add a calculated column.\nClick on the\nAdd calculated column\nicon at the top of the data table. The\nAdd calculated column\nmodule will open.\nEnter a name for the calculated column.\nSelect the appropriate column type.\nEnter the required formula or JavaScript code. Use\n(@)\nto refer to a column from the source.\nClick on\nValidate\nto preview the new column.\nCheck the\nRecalculate on add\noption for the table to instantly validate the expression and add values to the new column. Enabling this checkbox avoids the need to reupload the data to populate the calculated column.\nClick on\nAdd column\nto finalize and add the calculated column to your data table.\nScenarios\nChange Column Format\nIn data analysis, it is often necessary to change the format of a column to meet specific requirements or conform to certain rules. With Infoveave, you can easily do this using calculated columns and custom JavaScript to transform data. In this tutorial, you learn how to add an alphabet as a prefix to numeric values in a column.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing sales information, including a\nCustomer ID\ncolumn with numeric values representing unique customer identifiers. In this example, you add the alphabet\nA\nto each\nCustomer ID\nvalue to create a new identifier format.\nJavaScript Code\nlet\ncustomerID\n= @\nCustomer\nID\n;\n// Get the value of the Customer ID column\nlet\nnewCustomerID\n=\n'\nA\n'\n+\ncustomerID\n.\ntoString\n();\n// Concatenate 'A' with the Customer ID and convert to string\nnewCustomerID\n;\n// Return the new Customer ID\nReplace Nulls\nDuring data preparation for analysis, you may encounter missing or null values that can impact the accuracy of your insights. Addressing these gaps is essential for meaningful analysis. Infoveave provides tools to efficiently handle such scenarios. In this tutorial, you explore how to replace null values with a specified text, such as\nNot available\n, using calculated columns in Infoveave.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing customer information where some fields may have missing values. Focus on the\nAge\ncolumn and replace null values with\nNot available\n.\nJavaScript Code\nlet\nage\n= @\nAge\n;\n// Replace 'Age' with the actual column name\nif\n(\nage\n===\nnull\n||\nage\n===\n\"\"\n) {\nage\n=\n\"\nNot available\n\"\n;\n// Replace null or empty values with \"Not available\"\n}\nage\n;\n// Return the modified value\nReplace Column Values\nYou may need to modify specific values in your dataset to reflect updated information or new business requirements. With Infoveave’s calculated columns feature, you can achieve this easily by applying custom JavaScript code to manipulate your data. In this tutorial, you learn how to replace specific values in a column. Use an example dataset where you update the dealer name\nSipes Group\nto\nNew Spkies\ndue to a recent company merger.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing dealer information where some fields may contain incorrect values. Focus on the\nDealer Name\ncolumn and replace\nSipes Group\nwith\nNew Spkies\n.\nJavaScript Code\nlet\ndealerName\n= @\nDealer\nName\n;\n// Access the value of the \"Dealer Name\" column\n// Check if the dealerName is \"Sipes Group\", replace with \"New Spkies\", else keep the original value\nif\n(\ndealerName\n===\n\"\nSipes Group\n\"\n) {\ndealerName\n=\n\"\nNew Spkies\n\"\n;\n}\ndealerName\n;\n// Return the modified value\nRemove Timestamps from Date Columns\nIn data analysis, it is common that the date columns contain timestamps. In certain cases, you may need to remove the time stamp analysis or visualization. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to remove timestamps from date columns using Infoveave’s calculated columns feature. We will use an example dataset containing order information with timestamps and show how to extract and format the date portion only.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing order information with timestamps in the “Order Date” column. We want to remove the timestamps and display only the date portion.\nJavaScript Code\nvar\ntime\n= @\nOrder\nDate\n;\nvar\nnewTime\n=\ntime\n?\ntime\n.\nsplit\n(\n\"\n\"\n)[\n0\n]\n:\nnew\nDate\n()\n.\ntoISOString\n()\n.\nsplit\n(\n\"\nT\n\"\n)[\n0\n];\nvar\nparts\n=\nnewTime\n.\nsplit\n(\n\"\n-\n\"\n);\nvar\nformattedDate\n=\nparts\n[\n2\n]\n+\n\"\n-\n\"\n+\nparts\n[\n1\n]\n+\n\"\n-\n\"\n+\nparts\n[\n0\n];\nformattedDate\n;\nAdd Conditional Filters\nFiltering data based on specific conditions is a common task in data analysis to focus on relevant subsets of data. With Infoveave, you can implement conditional filters using JavaScript code within calculated columns. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a conditional filter to select rows based on a specific condition. Use an example of filtering customers older than 30 years from the dataset.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing employee information with columns for\nEmployee Name\nand\nAge\n. You want to filter out employees who are older than 30 years.\nJavaScript Code\nvar\nage\n= @\nAge\n;\nif\n(\nage\n&&\nage\n<=\n30\n) {\ntrue\n;\n}\nelse\n{\nfalse\n;\n}"

They enable you to generate custom views of your data using SQL queries on any Datasource within Infoveave. You can update, enrich, or selectively modify your data using different ingestion methods. This provides flexibility in managing data without compromising the structure of your queries. Lists make it easier to handle live data, conduct deeper analysis, and share insights in downloadable formats.\nUsing\nInfoveave\n, you can create dynamic lists that reflect live data. You can apply selected dimension filters while creating a list to assist in your analysis. These lists can be downloaded for further examination. It is easy to search for and preview any list you need. You can then download it in formats like CSV or Excel.\nCreating Lists\nInfoveave Lists allows you to create and manage a list of selected columns generated through SQL Queries on any Datasource within Infoveave.\nTo create a List in Infoveave using any existing Datasource, click on\nStudio\nLists\n.\nAll lists created by you or shared with you are displayed under the tabs\nMy Lists\nand\nShared Lists\nrespectively.\nTo create a new list, click on\nNew List\n.\nAssign a name to the new list.\nSelect the connection.\nSelect the Key column for the list.\nWrite the query.\nValidate the list by clicking the\nValidate\nbutton.\nSelect the data ingestion type by clicking the appropriate button.\nReload\nThis allows the parent query to reload.

It allows you to insert new columns into the list without altering the parent query.\nUpsert\nThis option lets you add a sub-query for a parent query using the\nUpsert query\nfield. You also have to select a key column to insert and update the list without changing the parent query, using the\nSelect key columns\nfield.\nTo save the list you created, click\nSave\n.\nTo view the list, click on the\nView\nicon. To know more about viewing list, visit\nViewing a list\nThe newly created list is now visible under\nStudio\nLists\n.\nScenarios for Data Ingestion Types\nYou are managing a dataset that stores customer information and purchase records for an e-commerce platform. This dataset contains data on customers, their orders, and their purchase history. You need to create a list to analyze this data more effectively. You have the following options for data ingestion.\nReload\nSuppose you have a parent query that retrieves customer data, including contact information and order history. You want to keep this list updated as new orders and customer details are added. By selecting the\nReload\noption, you can refresh the list.\nWhen you choose Reload, Infoveave truncates the existing data in your list and replaces it with the most recent data from the parent query. This ensures that your list always reflects the latest customer and order information. This option is especially useful when your Datasource is frequently updated and you want to maintain a real-time or near real-time view of your data.\nInsert\nSuppose you want to enhance your list by adding new columns, such as a\nTotal Purchase Amount\ncolumn that calculates the sum of purchases for each customer. By choosing the\nInsert\noption, you can do this without modifying the original parent query.\nWith the Insert option, you create a sub-query that calculates the Total Purchase Amount and inserts it into the list as a new column. This sub-query works independently, allowing you to enrich your list with additional data while keeping the core customer data query unchanged. It gives you the flexibility to customize your list with calculated fields or data from related sources.\nUpsert\nConsider a situation where you need to update specific information in your list. For example, some customers have changed their addresses and you want your list to reflect these updates without reloading all the customer data. By selecting\nUpsert\n, you can do this efficiently.\nWith Upsert, you define a sub-query that includes the updated customer addresses. You also specify a key column to identify which customer records need to be updated. Infoveave handles the insertion and update of the data in your list, updating only the records that have changed while preserving the rest. This approach helps you maintain data accuracy without changing the parent query structure.\nManaging Lists\nTo learn more about managing lists, visit\nManaging Lists\n.\nDownloading Lists from Insights\nInsights\nLists\nin Infoveave gives you easy access to downloadable data lists. You can quickly find and preview the list you want and download it in formats like CSV or Excel. This helps you simplify data retrieval and use the downloaded data for analysis or sharing.\nClick on the\nInsights\nsection in the Infoveave menu.\nIn the Insights layout, find the\nLists\noption.\nBrowse through the lists or use the search bar for quick access.\nAfter you find the list you want, click on it to open the list details. You are redirected to the List View.\nIn the List View, you can preview the contents of the list including the data and columns.\nTo download the list, click on the\nDownload\nbutton."

    "content": "Calculated Columns | Infoveave Help\nSkip to content\nCalculated Columns\nCalculated columns in Infoveave allow you to create new data columns based on existing data. By using JavaScript, you can perform complex transformations and clean column values directly within Infoveave. This enables you to manipulate and refine your data to meet specific analysis requirements.\nConfiguring Calculated Columns\nHere is a step-by-step guide to configure calculated columns in Infoveave.\nOpen the required table in the\nDatasource Designer\n.\nChoose the data table where you want to add a calculated column.\nClick on the\nAdd calculated column\nicon at the top of the data table. The\nAdd calculated column\nmodule will open.\nEnter a name for the calculated column.\nSelect the appropriate column type.\nEnter the required formula or JavaScript code. Use\n(@)\nto refer to a column from the source.\nClick on\nValidate\nto preview the new column.\nCheck the\nRecalculate on add\noption for the table to instantly validate the expression and add values to the new column. Enabling this checkbox avoids the need to reupload the data to populate the calculated column.\nClick on\nAdd column\nto finalize and add the calculated column to your data table.\nScenarios\nChange Column Format\nIn data analysis, it is often necessary to change the format of a column to meet specific requirements or conform to certain rules. With Infoveave, you can easily do this using calculated columns and custom JavaScript to transform data. In this tutorial, you learn how to add an alphabet as a prefix to numeric values in a column.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing sales information, including a\nCustomer ID\ncolumn with numeric values representing unique customer identifiers. In this example, you add the alphabet\nA\nto each\nCustomer ID\nvalue to create a new identifier format.\nJavaScript Code\nlet\ncustomerID\n= @\nCustomer\nID\n;\n// Get the value of the Customer ID column\nlet\nnewCustomerID\n=\n'\nA\n'\n+\ncustomerID\n.\ntoString\n();\n// Concatenate 'A' with the Customer ID and convert to string\nnewCustomerID\n;\n// Return the new Customer ID\nReplace Nulls\nDuring data preparation for analysis, you may encounter missing or null values that can impact the accuracy of your insights. Addressing these gaps is essential for meaningful analysis. Infoveave provides tools to efficiently handle such scenarios. In this tutorial, you explore how to replace null values with a specified text, such as\nNot available\n, using calculated columns in Infoveave.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing customer information where some fields may have missing values. Focus on the\nAge\ncolumn and replace null values with\nNot available\n.\nJavaScript Code\nlet\nage\n= @\nAge\n;\n// Replace 'Age' with the actual column name\nif\n(\nage\n===\nnull\n||\nage\n===\n\"\"\n) {\nage\n=\n\"\nNot available\n\"\n;\n// Replace null or empty values with \"Not available\"\n}\nage\n;\n// Return the modified value\nReplace Column Values\nYou may need to modify specific values in your dataset to reflect updated information or new business requirements. With Infoveave’s calculated columns feature, you can achieve this easily by applying custom JavaScript code to manipulate your data. In this tutorial, you learn how to replace specific values in a column. Use an example dataset where you update the dealer name\nSipes Group\nto\nNew Spkies\ndue to a recent company merger.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing dealer information where some fields may contain incorrect values. Focus on the\nDealer Name\ncolumn and replace\nSipes Group\nwith\nNew Spkies\n.\nJavaScript Code\nlet\ndealerName\n= @\nDealer\nName\n;\n// Access the value of the \"Dealer Name\" column\n// Check if the dealerName is \"Sipes Group\", replace with \"New Spkies\", else keep the original value\nif\n(\ndealerName\n===\n\"\nSipes Group\n\"\n) {\ndealerName\n=\n\"\nNew Spkies\n\"\n;\n}\ndealerName\n;\n// Return the modified value\nRemove Timestamps from Date Columns\nIn data analysis, it is common that the date columns contain timestamps. In certain cases, you may need to remove the time stamp analysis or visualization. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to remove timestamps from date columns using Infoveave’s calculated columns feature. We will use an example dataset containing order information with timestamps and show how to extract and format the date portion only.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing order information with timestamps in the “Order Date” column. We want to remove the timestamps and display only the date portion.\nJavaScript Code\nvar\ntime\n= @\nOrder\nDate\n;\nvar\nnewTime\n=\ntime\n?\ntime\n.\nsplit\n(\n\"\n\"\n)[\n0\n]\n:\nnew\nDate\n()\n.\ntoISOString\n()\n.\nsplit\n(\n\"\nT\n\"\n)[\n0\n];\nvar\nparts\n=\nnewTime\n.\nsplit\n(\n\"\n-\n\"\n);\nvar\nformattedDate\n=\nparts\n[\n2\n]\n+\n\"\n-\n\"\n+\nparts\n[\n1\n]\n+\n\"\n-\n\"\n+\nparts\n[\n0\n];\nformattedDate\n;\nAdd Conditional Filters\nFiltering data based on specific conditions is a common task in data analysis to focus on relevant subsets of data. With Infoveave, you can implement conditional filters using JavaScript code within calculated columns. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a conditional filter to select rows based on a specific condition. Use an example of filtering customers older than 30 years from the dataset.\nExample\nConsider a dataset containing employee information with columns for\nEmployee Name\nand\nAge\n. You want to filter out employees who are older than 30 years.\nJavaScript Code\nvar\nage\n= @\nAge\n;\nif\n(\nage\n&&\nage\n<=\n30\n) {\ntrue\n;\n}\nelse\n{\nfalse\n;\n}"

They enable you to generate custom views of your data using SQL queries on any Datasource within Infoveave. You can update, enrich, or selectively modify your data using different ingestion methods. This provides flexibility in managing data without compromising the structure of your queries. Lists make it easier to handle live data, conduct deeper analysis, and share insights in downloadable formats.\nUsing\nInfoveave\n, you can create dynamic lists that reflect live data. You can apply selected dimension filters while creating a list to assist in your analysis. These lists can be downloaded for further examination. It is easy to search for and preview any list you need. You can then download it in formats like CSV or Excel.\nCreating Lists\nInfoveave Lists allows you to create and manage a list of selected columns generated through SQL Queries on any Datasource within Infoveave.\nTo create a List in Infoveave using any existing Datasource, click on\nStudio\nLists\n.\nAll lists created by you or shared with you are displayed under the tabs\nMy Lists\nand\nShared Lists\nrespectively.\nTo create a new list, click on\nNew List\n.\nAssign a name to the new list.\nSelect the connection.\nSelect the Key column for the list.\nWrite the query.\nValidate the list by clicking the\nValidate\nbutton.\nSelect the data ingestion type by clicking the appropriate button.\nReload\nThis allows the parent query to reload. It truncates and reloads the existing column data in the list.\nInsert\nThis option lets you select and insert a sub-query for a parent query using the\nInsert query\nfield. It allows you to insert new columns into the list without altering the parent query.\nUpsert\nThis option lets you add a sub-query for a parent query using the\nUpsert query\nfield. You also have to select a key column to insert and update the list without changing the parent query, using the\nSelect key columns\nfield.\nTo save the list you created, click\nSave\n.\nTo view the list, click on the\nView\nicon. To know more about viewing list, visit\nViewing a list\nThe newly created list is now visible under\nStudio\nLists\n.\nScenarios for Data Ingestion Types\nYou are managing a dataset that stores customer information and purchase records for an e-commerce platform. This dataset contains data on customers, their orders, and their purchase history. You need to create a list to analyze this data more effectively. You have the following options for data ingestion.\nReload\nSuppose you have a parent query that retrieves customer data, including contact information and order history. You want to keep this list updated as new orders and customer details are added. By selecting the\nReload\noption, you can refresh the list.\nWhen you choose Reload, Infoveave truncates the existing data in your list and replaces it with the most recent data from the parent query. This ensures that your list always reflects the latest customer and order information. This option is especially useful when your Datasource is frequently updated and you want to maintain a real-time or near real-time view of your data.\nInsert\nSuppose you want to enhance your list by adding new columns, such as a\nTotal Purchase Amount\ncolumn that calculates the sum of purchases for each customer. By choosing the\nInsert\noption, you can do this without modifying the original parent query.\nWith the Insert option, you create a sub-query that calculates the Total Purchase Amount and inserts it into the list as a new column. This sub-query works independently, allowing you to enrich your list with additional data while keeping the core customer data query unchanged. It gives you the flexibility to customize your list with calculated fields or data from related sources.\nUpsert\nConsider a situation where you need to update specific information in your list. For example, some customers have changed their addresses and you want your list to reflect these updates without reloading all the customer data. By selecting\nUpsert\n, you can do this efficiently.\nWith Upsert, you define a sub-query that includes the updated customer addresses. You also specify a key column to identify which customer records need to be updated. Infoveave handles the insertion and update of the data in your list, updating only the records that have changed while preserving the rest. This approach helps you maintain data accuracy without changing the parent query structure.\nManaging Lists\nTo learn more about managing lists, visit\nManaging Lists\n.\nDownloading Lists from Insights\nInsights\nLists\nin Infoveave gives you easy access to downloadable data lists. You can quickly find and preview the list you want and download it in formats like CSV or Excel. This helps you simplify data retrieval and use the downloaded data for analysis or sharing.\nClick on the\nInsights\nsection in the Infoveave menu.\nIn the Insights layout, find the\nLists\noption.\nBrowse through the lists or use the search bar for quick access.\nAfter you find the list you want, click on it to open the list details. You are redirected to the List View.\nIn the List View, you can preview the contents of the list including the data and columns.\nTo download the list, click on the\nDownload\nbutton."
