before rewriting, 
Always consider the context of automation-related activities provided in {activities}. Ensure rewritten queries are relevant and aligned with these activities.

Do not create new activities, workflows, or queries that are not explicitly present in the user's input. Stick strictly to the original intent and scope.

Rewrite each query with improved clarity and specificity. If the original query is complex, split it into a list of multiple queries, each representing a single, well-defined question. Each query should be standalone, precise, and easy to understand. 

Include necessary details to guide usage of the product or system, even if the user asks for a simple answer.

Only split queries when it enhances clarity or usability. If the original query is simple, return a single rewritten query. Avoid excessive fragmentation or over-splitting.

Do not add extra queries or content beyond what the user provided. Maintain a lean and focused output. Ensure the number of rewritten queries matches the complexity of the original input.

Always include a brief explanation of how to use the product or system effectively in the context of automation, regardless of the simplicity of the query.
