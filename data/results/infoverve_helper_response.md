Here's a breakdown of how to create a workflow in Infoveave to download a report based on your Oracle query and send it via email:

**1.  Set Up Your Oracle Connection:**

*   **Infoveave Database Connection:** You'll need to establish a connection to your Oracle database within Infoveave. This involves providing the necessary credentials (username, password, hostname, port, and service name). Refer to the Infoveave documentation for detailed instructions on configuring database connections.

**2.  Create a Query Activity:**

*   **Execute Query:** Use the "Execute Query" activity to run your pre-written Oracle query. This activity will fetch the data from your database based on the query's criteria.

**3.  Generate the Report:**

*   **Report Generation:**  Infoveave likely offers various report generation options. You'll need to select the appropriate format (e.g., PDF, Excel) and configure the report layout to display the data retrieved from your Oracle query.

**4.  Download the Report:**

*   **Download Report Activity:**  Use the "Download Report" activity to save the generated report to a temporary location within Infoveave.

**5.  Send the Email:**

*   **Email Activity:**  Utilize the "Send Email" activity to compose and send the email.
    *   **Recipient:** Specify the email address(es) of the recipient(s).
    *   **Subject:** Set a descriptive subject line for the email.
    *   **Body:**  You can include a personalized message in the email body.
    *   **Attachment:** Attach the downloaded report file to the email.

**6.  Workflow Configuration:**

*   **Sequence:** Arrange these activities in the correct order within your workflow. The query should execute first, followed by report generation, download, and finally, email sending.
*   **Data Flow:** Ensure that the data retrieved from the Oracle query is properly passed to the report generation and email activities.

**Example Workflow:**

1.  **Execute Query (Oracle):**  Run your Oracle query.
2.  **Generate Report (Infoveave):** Create a report based on the query results.
3.  **Download Report:** Save the report as a PDF file.
4.  **Send Email:** Compose an email with the report as an attachment and send it to the specified recipient.
