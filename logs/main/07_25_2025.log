[ 2025-07-25 12:35:23,366 ] main.py:192 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create this workflow in Infoveave. 

**Here's a step-by-step guide:**

1. **Start with the 'Execute API' Activity:**

   - This activity will fetch data from your external API. 
   - You'll need to provide the API endpoint URL, authentication details (if required), and any necessary parameters.
   -  Infoveave will handle the API call and return the response data.

2. **Create a New Datasource:**

   -  After the 'Execute API' activity successfully retrieves data, you'll want to store it in a structured format within Infoveave.
   -  Use the 'Create Datasource' activity.
   -  Select the 'From Response' option and choose the response from the 'Execute API' activity.
   -  Give your new datasource a descriptive name.

3. **Perform Calculations:**

   - Now that your data is in a datasource, you can use various calculation activities:
     - **'Transform' Activity:** This is highly versatile. You can use JavaScript within this activity to perform complex calculations, data manipulation, and transformations on your data.
     - **'Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide' Activities:** For simpler arithmetic operations, these dedicated activities are available.
     - **'Aggregate' Activities:**  Use activities like 'Sum', 'Average', 'Count', 'Min', 'Max' to perform aggregations on your data.

4. **Link Activities:**

   -  Connect the activities in a logical sequence:
      - 'Execute API' -> 'Create Datasource' -> 'Transform' (or other calculation activities)

5. **Optional: Additional Activities:**

   -  Depending on your needs, you might include other activities:
      - **'Filter' Activity:**  To refine your data based on specific criteria.
      - **'Round Numbers' Activity:** To format numerical results.
      - **'Rename Columns' Activity:** To adjust column names for clarity.

6. **Save and Test:**

   -  Save your workflow with a meaningful name.
   -  Test your workflow thoroughly to ensure it executes as expected and produces the desired results.



**Important Considerations:**

- **API Documentation:** Carefully review the documentation for your target API to understand its endpoints, required parameters, authentication methods, and response format.
- **Data Structure:**  Think about how the API response data will be structured. You'll need to map it to the appropriate columns in your new datasource.
- **Error Handling:**  Implement error handling mechanisms within your workflow to gracefully handle potential API errors or data issues.

[ 2025-07-25 13:02:27,566 ] main.py:196 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create this workflow in Infoveave. 

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Start with the 'Execute API' Activity:**

   - Navigate to the Workflow Designer in Infoveave.
   - Drag and drop the 'Execute API' activity from the activity panel onto the canvas.
   - Configure the activity:
     - Provide the API endpoint URL.
     - Specify any necessary authentication details (API keys, tokens, etc.).
     - Define the request method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
     - If required, include request headers and body parameters.

2. **Create a Datasource from the API Response:**

   -  After the 'Execute API' activity, you'll need to create a new datasource from the API response.  Infoveave likely has an activity specifically designed for this, such as "Create Datasource from Response" or something similar. Look for an activity that allows you to define a datasource based on the output of another activity.
   - Configure this activity:
     - Select the 'Execute API' activity as the source of the data.
     - Choose a suitable name for your new datasource.
     - Define any necessary schema or data mapping if the API response isn't structured in a way that directly aligns with your desired data model.

3. **Perform Calculations:**

   - Now that you have a datasource containing the API data, you can add activities to perform calculations.  Infoveave likely offers activities like:
     - 'Transform' (for data manipulation and calculations)
     - 'Calculate' (for specific mathematical operations)
     - 'Aggregate' (for grouping and summarizing data)

   - Configure these activities:
     - Select the appropriate datasource as the input.
     - Define the calculations you want to perform using the available functions and operators.

4. **Link Activities:**

   - Connect the activities in a logical sequence using the output of one activity as the input for the next.  

5. **Additional Considerations:**

   - **Error Handling:**  Include error handling mechanisms in your workflow to gracefully handle potential issues with the API call or data processing.
   - **Logging:** Add logging activities to track the progress and status of your workflow.
   - **Workflow Triggers:**  Explore options for automatically triggering your workflow based on events or schedules.

[ 2025-07-25 13:04:34,718 ] main.py:198 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create this workflow in Infoveave. 

**1. Starting Point: The 'Execute API' Activity**

*   **Access:** Navigate to the Workflow Designer within Infoveave (Automation > Workflows > New Workflow).
*   **Adding the Activity:** Drag and drop the "Execute API" activity from the activity panel onto your workflow canvas.

*   **Configuration:**
    *   **API Endpoint:**  Enter the URL of the API you want to interact with.
    *   **Method:** Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) appropriate for your API.
    *   **Headers:**  If your API requires authentication or specific headers, add them here.
    *   **Body:**  If your API requires data to be sent in the request body, enter it here.
    *   **Response Handling:**  Infoveave will automatically parse the API response. You can configure how to handle different response types (JSON, XML, etc.).

**2. Creating a Datasource from the API Response**

*   **Data Source Activity:** Drag and drop the "Create Datasource" activity onto your canvas.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Name:** Give your new datasource a descriptive name.
    *   **Type:** Select "API Response" as the datasource type.
    *   **Source:**  Choose the "Execute API" activity as the source of the data.

**3. Performing Calculations**

*   **Transform Activity:** Drag and drop the "Transform" activity onto your canvas.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Script:**  Write JavaScript code within the "Transform" activity to perform your calculations on the data from the newly created datasource. You can use Infoveave's built-in functions and libraries for data manipulation.

**4. Additional Activities (Optional)**

*   **Filter:** Use a "Filter" activity to refine your data based on specific criteria.
*   **Round Numbers:** Use a "Round Numbers" activity to format numerical values.
*   **Rename Columns:** Use a "Rename Columns" activity to adjust column names for clarity.
*   **Drop Columns:** Use a "Drop Columns" activity to remove unnecessary columns.
*   **Upload to Datasource:** If you want to store the processed data, use an "Upload to Datasource" activity to write it to an existing or new datasource.

**5. Connecting Activities**

*   **Linking:** Connect the output of each activity to the input of the next activity using the visual links provided in the Workflow Designer.

**6. Validation and Execution**

*   **Validate:** Click the "Validate" button to ensure your workflow is correctly configured.
*   **Save:** Click "Save" to save your workflow.
*   **Start:**  You can then start your workflow to execute the entire process.



Let me know if you have any more questions about specific activities or need help with the JavaScript code for your calculations!

[ 2025-07-25 18:08:33,524 ] main.py:223 root - INFO - Here's a breakdown of how to create a workflow in Infoveave to execute an API, create a data source from the response, and then perform calculations on that data:

**1.  Start with the 'Execute API' Activity:**

*   **Connection:** Choose the connection that defines how your workflow will interact with the API (e.g., API key, OAuth token).
*   **API Endpoint:**  Enter the full URL of the API endpoint you want to call.
*   **Request Type:** Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) appropriate for the API.
*   **Headers:**  If the API requires authentication or specific headers, add them here.
*   **Parameters:**  Provide any required query parameters for the API call.

**2. Create a Data Source from the API Response:**

*   **Use the 'Create Data Source' Activity:** This activity will take the JSON response from your 'Execute API' call and store it as a new data source within your Infoveave workflow.
*   **Name Your Data Source:** Give your data source a descriptive name for easy reference.

**3.  Perform Calculations:**

*   **Use the 'Transform' Activity:** This activity allows you to apply JavaScript expressions to your data. You can use it to:
    *   Calculate new columns based on existing data.
    *   Filter rows based on conditions.
    *   Modify existing data values.
*   **Access Data from the Data Source:** Within your JavaScript expressions, you can reference columns from your newly created data source.

**4.  Additional Activities (Optional):**

*   **'Round Numbers' Activity:** Round numerical values in your data.
*   **'Group By' Activity:**  Aggregate data based on specific columns.
*   **'Filter' Activity:**  Select specific rows based on criteria.
*   **'Export' Activity:**  Save your transformed data to a file (e.g., CSV, Excel).

**Example Workflow:**

1.  **Execute API:** Call a weather API to get current conditions for a city.
2.  **Create Data Source:** Store the API response (likely JSON) as a data source named "WeatherData".
3.  **Transform:**
    *   Calculate the temperature in Celsius (if the API returns Fahrenheit).
    *   Create a new column indicating "Feels Like" based on a formula using temperature and humidity.
4.  **Round Numbers:** Round the calculated "Feels Like" temperature to the nearest whole number.
5.  **Export:** Save the transformed data to a CSV file named "WeatherReport.csv".
