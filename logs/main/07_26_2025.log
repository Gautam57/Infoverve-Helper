[ 2025-07-26 18:51:02,622 ] main.py:252 root - INFO - Let's craft that workflow!  

While Infoveave doesn't have a built-in "Create Data Source from API Response" activity, we can achieve this by combining a few existing activities. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Execute API Activity:**

   - This is your starting point. You'll use this activity to send a request to your API and capture the response.

2. **Parse JSON Activity:**

   -  Since APIs often return data in JSON format, you'll need to use the "Parse JSON" activity to transform the raw API response into a structured format that Infoveave can understand.

3. **Create Data Source Activity:**

   -  Infoveave offers a "Create Data Source" activity that allows you to establish a connection to various data sources. You'll use this activity to create a temporary data source based on the parsed JSON data.

4. **Data Transformation Activities:**

   - Now that you have your data in a usable format, you can apply various transformation activities to perform calculations:
      - **Read Data Source Activity:** Read the data from the newly created data source.
      - **Transform Activity (using JavaScript):**  This activity lets you write custom JavaScript expressions to perform calculations, aggregations, or any other data manipulation you need.
      - **Other Transformation Activities:** Infoveave provides a range of other activities like "Round Numbers," "Concatenate," "Filter," and more, which you can use to refine your data.

5. **Output:**

   - Finally, you can use an "Upload to Datasource" activity to store the transformed data in your desired destination (e.g., a database, data warehouse, or cloud storage).

**Important Considerations:**

- **API Authentication:** Ensure you handle API authentication correctly within the "Execute API" activity.

- **Data Structure:** Understand the structure of the JSON response from your API to map it effectively to the "Create Data Source" activity and subsequent transformations.

- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle potential issues during API calls or data processing.

1. **Execute API Activity:** Begin by using the "Execute API" activity.  In this activity, you'll define the API endpoint you want to interact with, the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), any necessary headers, query parameters, and the body content if required.  Configure the activity to receive the API response.

2. **Create Data Source:** Next, use the "Create Data Source" activity. Select "IOT" as the data source type.  You'll then need to upload the data received from the API response.  Name your data source and table appropriately.

3. **Transform Data (Optional):** If you need to perform calculations or modifications on the data from the API response, you can use the "Transform Activity using Javascript" to write custom JavaScript code for data manipulation.

4. **Additional Activities:** Depending on your specific calculations, you might need to use other activities like:
   - "Round Numbers Activity" for rounding numerical values.
   - "Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide" activities for basic arithmetic operations.
   - "Aggregate data by column" or "Aggregate data by time" activities for summarizing data.

5. **Upload to Datasource:** Finally, use the "Upload to Datasource" activity to save the transformed data back into your newly created data source.

[ 2025-07-26 20:05:52,634 ] main.py:272 root - INFO - Let's build that workflow! Here's a breakdown of how to use the 'Execute API' activity to fetch data and then perform calculations within Infoveave:

**1. Setting Up the 'Execute API' Activity**

*   **Purpose:** This activity is your gateway to external data sources. You'll use it to retrieve information from an API and store it in Infoveave.

*   **Configuration:**

    *   **Connection:**  You'll need to establish a connection to your API. Infoveave supports various authentication methods like OAuth, Basic Auth, and API Keys.  Make sure you have the necessary credentials set up.
    *   **Request Type:** Specify the HTTP method you'll use (e.g., GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
    *   **Request URL:** Enter the complete URL endpoint for the API you want to call. You can use placeholders (like `{{args.param}}`) to dynamically insert values from previous activities.
    *   **Headers:**  If your API requires specific headers (like authorization tokens), add them here.
    *   **Parameters:**  Provide any required query parameters for your API call.
    *   **Body:** If your API requires data to be sent in the request body (e.g., for POST or PUT requests), enter it here in raw JSON or XML format.

*   **Output:** The 'Execute API' activity will return the API's response as JSON data.

**2. Creating a Data Source**

*   **Purpose:**  You'll use the API response to create a new data source in Infoveave. This will allow you to easily access and work with the retrieved data.

*   **Steps:**

    1.  **Navigate to Data Sources:** In Infoveave's interface, find the section for managing data sources.
    2.  **Create New Data Source:** Click the button to create a new data source.
    3.  **Select Data Type:** Choose the appropriate data type for your API response (e.g., JSON).
    4.  **Name Your Data Source:** Give your data source a descriptive name.
    5.  **Configure Ingestion:**

        *   **Data Source Type:** Select the type of data source (e.g., API).
        *   **Connection:** Choose the connection you established for your API.
        *   **Data:**  Select the 'Execute API' activity as the source of your data.

**3. Performing Calculations**

*   **Purpose:** Now that your API data is in Infoveave, you can use various transformation activities to perform calculations.

*   **Activities:**

    *   **Transform Activity (using Javascript):** This activity gives you the flexibility to write custom Javascript code for complex calculations.
    *   **Built-in Calculation Activities:** Infoveave likely has dedicated activities for common calculations like adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, rounding, etc.

*   **Example:**

    Let's say your API response contains data about products, including their price and quantity. You want to calculate the total value of each product.

    1.  **Transform Activity:** Use a 'Transform Activity' and write Javascript code to multiply the 'price' and 'quantity' fields for each product.
    2.  **Output:** The transformed data will now include a new field representing the total value.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Error Handling:**  Always consider error handling in your workflow. What happens if the API call fails or the data is not in the expected format?
*   **Data Validation:**  Validate your data after retrieving it from the API to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
