[ 2025-07-28 10:24:52,113 ] main.py:272 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create this workflow in Infoveave. 

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Execute API Activity:**

   - You'll start by using the "Execute API" activity. This activity lets you connect to any RESTful API and send requests. 
   -  You'll need to configure the following:
      - **API Endpoint:** The URL of the API you want to interact with.
      - **HTTP Method:**  Choose the appropriate method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the API's requirements.
      - **Headers:**  Include any necessary headers for authentication or data formatting.
      - **Query Parameters:**  Add any parameters needed to filter or refine the API response.
      - **Body Content:** If the API requires data to be sent in the request body, define it here.
      - **Response Parsing:**  Specify how you want to interpret the API's response. Infoveave can often automatically parse common formats like JSON.

   -  The "Execute API" activity will return the API's response as data.

2. **Create Data Source:**

   -  Next, you'll use the response from the "Execute API" activity to create a new data source in Infoveave. 
   -  This data source will store the data retrieved from the API.

3. **Transform Activity (Javascript):**

   -  Now that you have your data in a data source, you can use the "Transform Activity using Javascript" to perform calculations. 
   -  Javascript provides a powerful way to manipulate and analyze your data. You can:
      -  Calculate new columns based on existing data.
      -  Filter rows based on conditions.
      -  Aggregate data (e.g., sum, average, count).
      -  And much more!

4. **Additional Activities (Optional):**

   -  Depending on your specific needs, you might want to add other activities to your workflow:
      - **Round Numbers Activity:**  Round numerical values to a desired precision.
      - **Remove Duplicate Rows Activity:**  Eliminate duplicate entries from your data.
      - **Drop Columns Activity:**  Remove unnecessary columns from your data source.
      - **Rename Columns Activity:**  Change the names of your data columns for clarity.

5. **Execute and Monitor:**

   -  Once you've designed your workflow, execute it. Infoveave will run the activities in the order you've defined, processing your data and performing the calculations.
   -  You can monitor the workflow's execution status and view the results in Infoveave's interface.



**Important Notes:**

- **API Documentation:**  Make sure to carefully review the documentation for the API you're using to understand its endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and authentication requirements.

- **Data Structure:**  Think about the structure of the data you'll be receiving from the API and how you want to transform it.

- **Error Handling:**  Consider adding error handling to your workflow to gracefully handle unexpected situations.

[ 2025-07-28 10:28:48,204 ] main.py:272 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create a workflow in Infoveave that uses the "Execute API" activity to fetch data and then performs calculations on it.

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Execute API Activity:**

   - This is where you'll connect to your external API. 
   - **Configuration:**
     - **Connection:**  Set up your API connection details (authentication, endpoint URL).
     - **Request Type:** Choose the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the API's requirements.
     - **Request URL:**  Enter the full API endpoint URL. You can use placeholders (like `{{args.param}}`) to dynamically construct the URL if needed.
     - **Headers:**  Include any necessary headers for authentication or API interaction.
     - **Body:** If your API requires data in the request body (e.g., for POST or PUT requests), provide it here in JSON or XML format.
     - **Continue Execution on Failure:**  Consider enabling this if your workflow should continue even if the API call encounters an error.

2. **Create Data Source Activity:**

   - This activity takes the API response and creates a new data source within Infoveave.
   - **Configuration:**
     - **Data Source Type:** Select the appropriate data source type based on the API response format (e.g., CSV, JSON, XML).
     - **Data Source Name:** Give your new data source a descriptive name.
     - **Table Name:**  Choose a name for the table within the data source.
     - **Data:**  The API response data will be automatically used as the source for this data source.

3. **Transform Activity (Optional):**

   - If you need to modify the data structure or perform initial cleaning before calculations, use a "Transform" activity.
   - **Configuration:**
     - **Transformation Type:** Choose from various transformation options (e.g., JavaScript, SQL).
     - **Script/Query:** Write your transformation logic here.

4. **Calculation Activities:**

   - Now you can use various calculation activities to perform your desired operations on the data.
   - **Examples:**
     - **Round Numbers Activity:** Round numerical values.
     - **Add/Subtract/Multiply/Divide Activities:** Perform basic arithmetic.
     - **Custom Calculation Activity:**  Write your own complex calculations using JavaScript or other supported languages.

5. **Output/Visualization (Optional):**

   -  You can use activities like "Upload to Datasource" to store the calculated results in a new data source or "Visualize Data" to create charts and dashboards.



**Important Notes:**

- **API Documentation:**  Refer to the API documentation for the specific endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and authentication requirements.
- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling in your workflow to gracefully handle API failures or unexpected data.
- **Workflow Testing:** Thoroughly test your workflow with different inputs and scenarios to ensure it functions as expected.

[ 2025-07-28 10:38:36,878 ] main.py:272 root - INFO - Let's break down how to define a What-If Formula in Infoveave. 

Think of a What-If Formula as a tool to explore different scenarios by changing input values and seeing how the results change.

**Here's a step-by-step guide:**

1. **Navigate to the Formula Creation Area:**
   - Click on "Analysis" in the Infoveave menu.
   - Then, select "What-If Formulae".

2. **Create a New Formula:**
   - Click on the "New Formula" button.

3. **Provide Formula Details:**
   - **Name:** Give your formula a descriptive name so you can easily identify it later.
   - **Datasource or Query:** Choose the datasource containing your data or a related query with the necessary measures and dimensions.

4. **Save the Formula:**
   - Once you've entered the name and selected your datasource or query, click "Save" to add the What-If Formula to Infoveave.

**Understanding the Components:**

- **Measures:** These are the numerical values you want to analyze. You'll assign unique keys to each measure for easy reference.
- **Values:** These are the input values used in your formula. You can define them as numerical values or percentages.
- **Expressions:**  These are the formulas that combine measures and values to calculate the desired outcome. You can use standard mathematical functions or even JavaScript for more complex calculations.

**Example:**

Let's say you want to analyze the impact of changing sales prices on revenue.

1. **Formula Name:** "Sales Price Impact"
2. **Datasource:** Your sales data
3. **Measures:** "Sales Quantity", "Sales Price"
4. **Values:** "New Sales Price" (a variable representing the potential new price)
5. **Expression:** "Sales Quantity * New Sales Price" (calculates the new revenue)

**Key Points:**

- **Goal-Seeking:** What-If Formulae use a goal-seeking method. If you know the desired outcome (e.g., a target revenue) and the formula, you can use the formula to suggest input values (e.g., the new sales price) that would achieve that goal.
- **Filters:** You can apply filters to your What-If Formulae based on dimensions in your data to focus your analysis on specific segments or scenarios.

[ 2025-07-28 10:52:24,576 ] main.py:275 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create a workflow in Infoveave that uses the "Execute API" activity to fetch data and then performs calculations on it.

**1.  Start with the "Execute API" Activity:**

   - This activity is your gateway to interacting with external APIs. You'll define the API endpoint, HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, query parameters, and any necessary authentication.

   - **Example:**  Let's say you want to fetch data from a weather API. You'd configure the "Execute API" activity with:
      - **API Endpoint:**  `https://api.exampleweather.com/current_conditions`
      - **HTTP Method:** `GET`
      - **Query Parameters:** `city=London`

   - **Output:** The "Execute API" activity will return the API's response as data.

**2. Create a Data Source from the API Response:**

   - Infoveave allows you to create data sources dynamically from the output of activities.

   - **Steps:**
      -  In your workflow, add a "Create Data Source" activity.
      -  Select the "Data" output from the "Execute API" activity as the source for your new data source.
      -  Choose a suitable data source type (e.g., CSV, JSON, or a custom type if the API response has a specific format).
      -  Provide a name for your data source.

**3. Perform Calculations:**

   - Now that you have a data source containing the API response, you can use various activities to perform calculations:

   - **"Transform" Activity (with Javascript):**  This is powerful for complex calculations and data manipulation. You can write Javascript code to:
      -  Extract specific values from the API response.
      -  Perform mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, etc.).
      -  Apply conditional logic (if-else statements).
      -  Create new columns based on calculations.

   - **Other Calculation Activities:** Infoveave likely has dedicated activities for common calculations like:
      -  "Round Numbers"
      -  "Sum"
      -  "Average"
      -  "Min/Max"

**4.  Save or Use the Results:**

   -  **Save to a File:** You can use the "Upload to Datasource" activity to save the results of your calculations to a new data source (e.g., a database or a file).
   -  **Use in Subsequent Activities:** The calculated data can be used as input for other activities in your workflow.



Let me know if you have any more questions or want to explore specific calculation examples!

[ 2025-07-28 10:59:42,985 ] main.py:297 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create a workflow in Infoveave that uses an API call to fetch data and then performs calculations on it.

**Workflow Structure**

Your workflow will likely involve these key steps:

1. **Execute API:** Use the "Execute API" activity to retrieve data from your chosen API.
2. **Create Data Source:** Transform the API response into a format suitable for Infoveave and create a new data source.
3. **Data Transformation (Optional):**  If needed, use activities like "Filter," "Transform," or "Join" to refine the data before calculations.
4. **Calculated Measures:**  Leverage Infoveave's "Calculated Measures" feature to define your custom calculations.

**Detailed Steps**

1. **Execute API:**

   -  In your Infoveave workflow designer, add an "Execute API" activity.
   -  Provide the API endpoint URL.
   -  Specify any required authentication details (API keys, tokens, etc.).
   -  Configure the request method (GET, POST, etc.) and headers as needed by the API.

2. **Create Data Source:**

   -  After the API call, you'll need to create a data source from the response. Infoveave likely offers options to directly import data from various formats (JSON, CSV, etc.).
   -  Select the appropriate data import method based on the API response structure.
   -  Map the API response fields to columns in your new data source.
   -  Provide a descriptive name for your data source and table.

3. **Data Transformation (Optional):**

   -  If your API data requires cleaning, restructuring, or joining with other data, use activities like "Filter," "Transform," or "Join" to prepare it for calculations.

4. **Calculated Measures:**

   -  Open the Datasource Designer for your newly created data source.
   -  Click on the "+" icon next to "Calculated Measure" to add a new calculated measure.
   -  Give your calculated measure a meaningful name.
   -  Choose a date filtering behavior (e.g., "First Date," "Last Date").
   -  Configure the format, prefix, suffix, and precision of the calculated measure.
   -  Use the formula builder to define your calculation using existing columns, operators, and functions.
   -  Validate your formula to ensure accuracy.
   -  Click "Add Calculated Measure" to incorporate it into your data source.

**Important Considerations:**

- **API Documentation:** Carefully review the API documentation to understand its structure, authentication requirements, and rate limits.
- **Data Format:** Ensure the API response format (JSON, XML, CSV, etc.) is compatible with Infoveave's data import capabilities.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms in your workflow to gracefully handle API failures or unexpected data.

[ 2025-07-28 11:01:17,866 ] main.py:297 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create a workflow in Infoveave that uses an API call to fetch data and then performs calculations on it.

**Workflow Structure**

Your workflow will likely involve these key steps:

1. **Execute API:** Use the "Execute API" activity to retrieve data from your chosen API.
2. **Create Data Source:** Transform the API response into a format suitable for Infoveave and create a new data source.
3. **Data Transformation (Optional):**  If needed, use activities like "Filter," "Transform," or "Join" to refine the data before calculations.
4. **Calculated Measures:**  Leverage Infoveave's "Calculated Measures" feature to define your custom calculations.

**Detailed Steps**

1. **Execute API:**

   -  In your Infoveave workflow designer, add an "Execute API" activity.
   -  Provide the API endpoint URL.
   -  Specify any required authentication details (API keys, tokens, etc.).
   -  Configure the request method (GET, POST, etc.) and headers as needed by the API.

2. **Create Data Source:**

   -  After the API call, you'll need to create a data source from the response. Infoveave likely offers options to directly import data from various formats (JSON, CSV, etc.).
   -  Select the appropriate data import method based on the API response structure.
   -  Map the API response fields to columns in your new data source.
   -  Provide a descriptive name for your data source and table.

3. **Data Transformation (Optional):**

   -  If your API data requires cleaning, restructuring, or joining with other data, use activities like "Filter," "Transform," or "Join" to prepare it for calculations.

4. **Calculated Measures:**

   -  Open the Datasource Designer for your newly created data source.
   -  Click on the "+" icon next to "Calculated Measure" to add a new calculated measure.
   -  Give your calculated measure a meaningful name.
   -  Choose a date filtering behavior (e.g., "First Date," "Last Date").
   -  Configure the format, prefix, suffix, and precision of the calculated measure.
   -  Build the calculation formula using existing columns, operators, and functions.
   -  Validate your formula to ensure accuracy.
   -  Click "Add Calculated Measure" to incorporate it into your data source.

**Important Considerations:**

- **API Documentation:** Carefully review the API documentation to understand the response format, required parameters, and authentication methods.
- **Data Structure:**  Plan how you'll structure your data source to align with your calculation needs.
- **Error Handling:** Implement error handling mechanisms in your workflow to gracefully handle potential API issues or data inconsistencies.

[ 2025-07-28 11:02:55,735 ] main.py:298 root - INFO - Let's craft that workflow for you! 

Here's a breakdown of how to create a workflow in Infoveave that uses the 'Execute API' to fetch data and then performs calculations on it:

**1. Start with a New Workflow**

*   In your Infoveave dashboard, click on the "Workflows" tab.
*   Click the "New Workflow" button.

**2. Add the 'Execute API' Activity**

*   Search for "Execute API" in the activity library and drag it into your workflow canvas.
*   **Configure the 'Execute API' Activity:**
    *   **API Endpoint:**  Paste the URL of the API you want to interact with.
    *   **Method:** Select the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST, PUT) used by the API.
    *   **Headers:**  If your API requires authentication or specific headers, add them here.
    *   **Body:**  If your API requires data to be sent in the request body, enter it here.

**3. Create a Data Source from the API Response**

*   Connect the output of the 'Execute API' activity to a "Create Data Source" activity. You can find this activity in the "Data" category of the activity library.
*   **Configure the 'Create Data Source' Activity:**
    *   **Name:** Give your data source a descriptive name.
    *   **Type:** Select the appropriate data type for the API response (e.g., JSON, CSV).
    *   **Data:**  Infoveave will automatically detect the data structure from the API response.

**4. Add Calculation Activities**

*   Now that you have a data source, you can add calculation activities to process the data.
*   Infoveave offers a variety of calculation activities, such as:
    *   **Filter:**  Select specific rows from your data source based on conditions.
    *   **Transform:**  Modify the values in your data (e.g., convert data types, concatenate strings).
    *   **Aggregate:**  Calculate summary statistics (e.g., sum, average, count) on your data.

**5. Connect Activities and Visualize Results**

*   Connect the output of your calculation activities to other activities or visualizations as needed.
*   Infoveave provides a range of visualization options to help you understand your data.

**Example Workflow:**

Let's say you want to fetch weather data from an API and calculate the average temperature over a week.

1.  **Execute API:** Use the 'Execute API' activity to call the weather API and retrieve data for each day of the week.
2.  **Create Data Source:** Create a data source from the API response, likely in JSON format.
3.  **Filter:** Filter the data source to select only the temperature values.
4.  **Aggregate:** Use an "Aggregate" activity to calculate the average temperature.
5.  **Visualize:** Connect the output of the "Aggregate" activity to a line chart visualization to display the average temperature over the week.

[ 2025-07-28 11:06:16,646 ] main.py:298 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create a workflow in Infoveave to fetch data from an API and then perform calculations on it.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

**1.  Set up your API call:**

*   **Start with the "Execute API" activity:** This activity is your gateway to interact with external APIs.

*   **Configure the API details:**
    *   **Connection:**  Select the API connection you've already set up for your API. If you haven't set up a connection yet, you'll need to create one first.
    *   **Method:** Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the API's requirements.
    *   **URL:**  Enter the complete API endpoint URL.
    *   **Headers:**  Add any necessary headers (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type)
    *   **Body:** If your API requires data to be sent, define it here in JSON format.
    *   **Response Parsing:**  Infoveave will try to parse the API response.

**2. Create a Datasource from the API response:**

*   **Use the "Add Datasource" activity:** This activity transforms the API response into a structured data source.
*   **Configure the Datasource:**
    *   **Name:** Give your data source a descriptive name.
    *   **Type:** Select the appropriate data source type (e.g., JSON, CSV, etc.)
    *   **Data:**  Paste the API response from the previous step.

**3. Perform calculations:**

*   **Use the "Add Calculated Column" activity:** This is where you'll define your calculations.
*   **Configure the calculated column:**
    *   **Name:** Give your calculated column a name.
    *   **Formula:** Write your calculation logic here.

**4. Save and Test:**

*   **Save your workflow:** Give your workflow a name.
*   **Test your workflow:**  Run it to ensure it works as expected.

**Example:**

Let's say you want to get data from a weather API and calculate the average temperature over a week.

[ 2025-07-28 11:08:26,103 ] main.py:300 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create a workflow in Infoveave to fetch data from an API and then perform calculations.

**Workflow Steps**

Here's a step-by-step guide to build this workflow:

1. **Execute API Activity:**

   - **Name:**  Give your activity a descriptive name like "Fetch API Data"

   - **Connection:** Select the API connection you've already set up for your API.

   - **Request Type:** Choose the appropriate HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on your API's requirements.

   - **URL:** Enter the complete API endpoint URL.

   - **Headers:** Add any necessary headers (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type)

   - **Body:** If your API requires data to be sent in the request body, paste it here.

   - **Response Parsing:**  Select how you want to parse the response (JSON is common)

2. **Create Datasource from API Response:**

   - **Name:** Give your new Datasource a descriptive name.

   - **Type:** Select "API" as the Datasource type.

   - **API Response:**  Choose the "Data" output from the "Execute API" activity.

3. **Transform Data:**

   - **Name:**  Give your activity a descriptive name like "Transform Data"

   - **Input:** Select the Datasource you just created.

   - **Transform:** Use the "Transform" activity to clean, reshape, or modify the data as needed.

4. **Calculate Measures:**

   - **Name:** Give your activity a descriptive name like "Calculate Metrics"

   - **Input:** Select the transformed data from the previous activity.

   - **Calculation:** Define your calculations here.

5. **Save Datasource:**

   - **Name:** Give your new Datasource a descriptive name.

   - **Type:** Select "Data"

   - **Data:** Select the calculated data from the previous activity.

**Example:**

Let's say you want to fetch data from a weather API and calculate the average temperature over a week.

1. **Execute API:**

   - **Name:** Fetch Weather Data

   - **Connection:** Your API connection

   - **Request Type:** GET

   - **URL:** https://api.example.com/weather?city=London

2. **Create Datasource from API Response:**

   - **Name:** London Weather Data

   - **Type:** API

   - **API Response:** Data from the "Fetch Weather Data" activity

3. **Transform Data:**

   - **Name:** Clean Weather Data

   - **Input:** London Weather Data

   - **Transform:**

4. **Calculate Metrics:**

   - **Name:** Average Temperature

   - **Input:** Clean Weather Data

5. **Save Datasource:**

   - **Name:** Weekly Average

   - **Type:** Data

   - **Data:** Average Temperature

[ 2025-07-28 11:10:24,474 ] main.py:300 root - INFO - Here's a breakdown of how to create a workflow in Infoveave that uses the 'Execute API' activity to fetch data and then performs calculations on it:

**1.  Start with the 'Execute API' Activity:**

*   **Purpose:** This activity is your gateway to external data. You'll use it to retrieve information from an API.

*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Connection:** Select or create a connection to your API (if it requires authentication, you'll need to configure it here).
    *   **Base URL:** Enter the base URL of the API you're interacting with.
    *   **Request Type:** Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) appropriate for your API call.
    *   **Headers:**  Add any necessary headers for authentication or data formatting (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type).
    *   **Query Parameters:**  If your API uses query parameters to filter or modify the data, enter them here.
    *   **Body:** If your API requires data to be sent in the request body (e.g., for a POST request), enter it here in JSON format.
    *   **Root:** Specify the path within the API's response JSON from which to extract the data you want to use.

*   **Output:** The 'Execute API' activity will return the structured JSON response from the API.

**2. Create a Datasource from the API Response:**

*   **Purpose:**  Transform the API response into a structured data source that you can easily work with in your workflow.

*   **Steps:**
    *   In your workflow, add a 'Create Datasource' activity.
    *   Select 'From API Response' as the source type.
    *   Choose the 'Execute API' activity as the source.
    *   Configure the Datasource name and table name.
    *   Review and adjust the schema (column names and data types) of the Datasource based on the API response structure.

**3. Perform Calculations:**

*   **Purpose:**  Use the 'Calculated Column' activity to create new columns in your Datasource that contain calculated values.

*   **Configuration:**
    *   **Datasource:** Select the Datasource you created in the previous step.
    *   **Column Name:**  Give your new calculated column a meaningful name.
    *   **Formula:** Enter a formula using the existing columns in your Datasource to calculate the values for the new column. Infoveave supports a variety of functions for calculations.

**4.  Continue Your Workflow:**

*   **Purpose:**  Now that you have a Datasource with calculated columns, you can use it in other activities within your workflow, such as:
    *   **Filtering:**  Select data based on calculated values.
    *   **Sorting:**  Order data based on calculated values.
    *   **Aggregation:**  Summarize data using calculated values (e.g., calculate averages, totals, etc.).
    *   **Visualization:**  Create charts and dashboards that display calculated values.



**Example Scenario:**

Let's say you want to track product sales from an API and calculate the total revenue for each product.

1.  **Execute API:** Use the 'Execute API' activity to fetch product sales data from your API.
2.  **Create Datasource:** Create a Datasource from the API response, including columns for product ID, quantity sold, and price.
3.  **Calculated Column:** Add a calculated column named "Total Revenue" using the formula: `quantity_sold * price`.
4.  **Aggregation:** Use an 'Aggregate' activity to calculate the total revenue for each product.
5.  **Visualization:** Create a chart to visualize the total revenue for each product.

[ 2025-07-28 11:15:15,309 ] main.py:318 root - INFO - Let's build that workflow! Here's a breakdown of how to use 'Execute API' to fetch data and then perform calculations in Infoveave:

**1. Setting Up Your 'Execute API' Activity**

*   **API Endpoint:**  Start by identifying the API endpoint you want to interact with. This is the URL that will return the data you need.
*   **Authentication:**  Determine if the API requires authentication (e.g., API keys, tokens). If so, you'll need to provide the necessary credentials within the 'Execute API' activity.
*   **Request Method:**  Specify the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) appropriate for your API call.
*   **Request Body (if needed):**  If your API requires data to be sent in the request body, construct it according to the API's specifications.

**2. Creating a Data Source from the API Response**

*   **Data Source Type:**  Infoveave likely supports creating data sources directly from API responses. Look for an option to create a data source from the output of the 'Execute API' activity.
*   **Data Source Name:**  Give your new data source a descriptive name for easy identification.
*   **Data Source Configuration:**  Infoveave will guide you through configuring the data source based on the structure of the API response. This might involve specifying the format (JSON, XML), data schema, or any necessary transformations.

**3. Performing Calculations on the Data Source**

Now that you have a data source containing the API response, you can use Infoveave's calculation capabilities:

*   **Aggregate Functions:**  Use functions like `SUM`, `AVG`, `COUNT`, `MIN`, `MAX` to perform calculations on columns within your data source.
*   **Formula Builder:**  Infoveave likely provides a formula builder to create more complex calculations involving multiple columns, conditions, and mathematical operations.
*   **Custom Functions:**  Depending on Infoveave's capabilities, you might be able to define your own custom functions for specific calculations.

**Example Workflow:**

1.  **'Execute API' Activity:**
    *   API Endpoint: `https://api.example.com/data`
    *   Authentication: API Key (provided in the activity settings)
    *   Request Method: GET
2.  **Create Data Source:**
    *   Data Source Type: API Response
    *   Data Source Name: `API_Data`
    *   Configuration:  Specify the format and schema of the API response.
3.  **Calculation Activities:**
    *   **'Aggregate data by column' Activity:** Calculate the total value of a specific column in the `API_Data` data source.
    *   **'Formula' Activity:** Create a formula to calculate a new column based on existing columns in the `API_Data` data source.

**Remember:**

*   Consult Infoveave's documentation for detailed instructions on configuring activities and using its features.
*   Adapt this workflow to your specific API and calculation requirements.

[ 2025-07-28 11:17:53,019 ] main.py:336 root - INFO - While Infoveave offers powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities, it doesn't have a built-in feature specifically called "What-If Analysis" or "What-If Formula." 

What-If Analysis typically involves creating scenarios and dynamically changing input values to see how the results change.  

However, you can achieve similar functionality in Infoveave using a combination of its existing features:

1. **Parameterization:** You can define variables or parameters within your workflows that represent the input values you want to change.

2. **Conditional Logic:** Use "If" statements or other conditional branching to alter the workflow's execution based on the values of your parameters.

3. **Data Manipulation Activities:**  Utilize activities like "Filter on formula," "Calculate date difference," or "Execute Query" to perform calculations and manipulate data based on the current parameter values.

4. **Iteration:**  If you need to test multiple scenarios, consider using the "Start iteration" and "End iteration" activities to loop through different parameter combinations.

**Example:**

Let's say you want to analyze the impact of changing sales prices on revenue.

* **Parameterize:** Create a parameter called "SalesPrice" representing the price of a product.
* **Conditional Logic:**  Use an "If" statement to check if "SalesPrice" is above a certain threshold.
* **Data Manipulation:**  If the condition is met, calculate revenue based on the "SalesPrice" parameter. Otherwise, use a different revenue calculation.
* **Iteration:**  You could loop through different "SalesPrice" values to see how revenue changes.

Remember to document your parameters and logic clearly to understand the relationships between input values and the resulting outputs.

[ 2025-07-28 11:20:16,688 ] main.py:336 root - INFO - While Infoveave offers powerful data manipulation and analysis capabilities, it doesn't have a dedicated "What-If Analysis" feature like some specialized spreadsheet or business intelligence tools. 

However, you can achieve similar outcomes using Infoveave's existing functionalities. Here's a breakdown of how you might approach "What-If" scenarios:

1. **Parameterization:**

   -  Treat the variable you want to change in your analysis as a parameter. You can use Infoveave's "Static Lookup" activity to define a list of possible values for this parameter.

2. **Dynamic Calculations:**

   -  Create formulas or calculations that reference your parameter. For example, if you're analyzing sales, your parameter could be "Sales Discount Percentage." Your formula might calculate "Total Revenue = (Sales Amount) * (1 - Discount Percentage)."

3. **Iteration:**

   -  Use Infoveave's "Start Iteration" and "End Iteration" activities to loop through different values in your parameter list. For each iteration, execute your dynamic calculation and store the results.

4. **Visualization:**

   -  After running your iterations, visualize the results using Infoveave's charting or reporting capabilities. This will allow you to see the impact of different parameter values on your key metrics.

**Example:**

Let's say you want to analyze how different advertising spend levels affect your projected revenue.

- **Parameter:** "Advertising Spend" with values like $1000, $2000, $3000.
- **Formula:** "Projected Revenue = Base Revenue + (Advertising Spend * Conversion Rate)."
- **Iteration:** Loop through each "Advertising Spend" value, calculate the "Projected Revenue," and store the results.
- **Visualization:** Create a chart showing "Projected Revenue" against "Advertising Spend" to see the relationship.

**Remember:**

- This approach simulates "What-If" analysis. It doesn't provide predictive modeling or complex scenario planning like dedicated tools.
- You'll need to define your parameters, formulas, and iterations based on your specific business questions and data.

[ 2025-07-28 11:20:43,549 ] main.py:336 root - INFO - While Infoveave offers powerful data analysis capabilities, it doesn't explicitly mention a feature called "What-if Analysis" or "What-if Formulas" in its documentation. 

It's possible that this functionality is integrated into other features like "Execute What-if Analysis" or "Transform using javascript" which allow for dynamic calculations and data manipulation. 

To get a definitive answer on how to achieve "What-if" analysis in Infoveave, I recommend checking the following resources:

* **Infoveave's Official Documentation:** Look for sections related to data transformation, calculations, or scenario analysis. [https://www.infoveave.com/docs](https://www.infoveave.com/docs)
* **Infoveave's Community Forum or Support:** Post your question on their forum or contact their support team for specific guidance. [https://www.infoveave.com/contact](https://www.infoveave.com/contact)



Let me know if you have any other questions about Infoveave's features!

[ 2025-07-28 11:37:38,249 ] main.py:330 root - INFO - The provided text explains how to use What-If Formulas in Infoveave. 

Here's a breakdown of the process:

1. **Select What-If Formula:** When you initiate a What-If Analysis, you'll be presented with a list of available What-If Formulas. Choose the formula that best suits your analytical needs. This selection sets the framework for your analysis, defining the relationships and calculations involved.

2. **Execute Analysis:** After selecting your formula, initiate the analysis process. Infoveave will process the data based on the chosen formula and display the results in a table format. This table will showcase the calculated data derived from the What-If formula.



Let me know if you have any other questions about using What-If Formulas in Infoveave!

[ 2025-07-28 12:25:55,475 ] main.py:341 root - INFO - Let's break down how to define a What-If formula in Infoveave.

**Understanding What-If Formulas**

What-If formulas in Infoveave are powerful tools for exploring different scenarios. They let you set up calculations that change based on different inputs. Think of them like "what if" questions.

**Steps to Define a What-If Formula**

1. **Navigate to What-If Analysis:** Start by going to the "Analysis" menu and select "What-If Analysis".

2. **Create New Analysis:** Click the "New Analysis" button to begin creating a new What-If Analysis.

3. **Name Your Analysis:** Give your What-If Analysis a descriptive name so you can easily find it later.

4. **Select Formula:** Choose the formula you want to use for your What-If Analysis.

5. **Configure Measures and Values:**

* **Measures:** Select the measures you want to include in your What-If Analysis.

* **Values:** Define the starting values for your calculations.

6. **Define Expressions:**

* **Expression Type:** Choose the type of expression you need (Standard, JavaScript, or Standard String).

* **Expression:** Write the formula logic.

7. **Save Your What-If Analysis:** Once you're happy with your setup, click "Save" to store your What-If Analysis.

**Example: What-If Analysis for Sales:**

Let's say you want to see how changes in sales affect profit.

* **Measure:** Sales

* **Value:** Sales amount

* **Expression:** Profit = Sales * 

**

**Important Notes:**

[ 2025-07-28 16:55:21,819 ] main.py:340 root - INFO - Here's how you can create a workflow in Infoveave to execute an API, create a data source from the response, and then perform calculations:

**1.  Start with the "Execute API" Activity:**

*   **Name:** Give your activity a descriptive name, like "Fetch Data from API".
*   **Connection:** Select the appropriate connection to your API. If you haven't already, you'll need to configure this connection in Infoveave.
*   **Request Type:** Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) that your API uses.
*   **Request URL:** Enter the full API endpoint URL.
*   **Headers:** Add any necessary headers for authentication or special requests.
*   **Parameters:**  Provide any required parameters for your API call.
*   **Body:** If your API requires a request body, paste the JSON or XML data here.
*   **Continue Execution on Failure:** Decide if you want the workflow to continue even if the API call fails.

**2. Create a Data Source from the API Response:**

*   **Name:** Give your data source a descriptive name.
*   **Type:** Select "From API Response" as the data source type.
*   **API Response:** Choose the "Execute API" activity that fetched the data.

**3. Add Calculation Activities:**

*   Now that you have your data in a data source, you can use various calculation activities to process it:
    *   **Aggregate data by column:**  Sum, average, count, min, max, etc.
    *   **Transform using JavaScript:** For more complex calculations or data manipulation.
    *   **Custom functions:** If you have specific calculations, you might need to create custom functions.

**4. Save and Test:**

*   Save your workflow and test it to ensure it's working as expected.

**Example Workflow:**

Let's say you want to fetch data from a weather API and calculate the average temperature for a specific location over a period.

1.  **Execute API:**
    *   Name: Fetch Weather Data
    *   Connection: Weather API Connection
    *   Request Type: GET
    *   Request URL: https://api.example.com/weather?location=London&date_range=2023-08-01 to 2023-08-31
    *   Output: Store the API response in a variable named "weather_data"

2.  **Create Data Source:**
    *   Name: Weather Data Source
    *   Type: From API Response
    *   API Response: weather_data

3.  **Aggregate data by column:**
    *   Name: Calculate Average Temperature
    *   Data Source: Weather Data
    *   Column: temperature
    *   Aggregation: Average

4.  **Output:**
    *   Name: Average Temperature
    *   Value:  The result of the average temperature calculation

**Remember:**

*   Replace placeholders with your actual API details.
*   Adapt the workflow to your specific API and calculations.
*   Explore the Infoveave documentation for a complete list of available activities and their options.

[ 2025-07-28 17:01:53,789 ] main.py:341 root - INFO - Let's break down how to create a workflow to fetch data from an API and then perform calculations on it.

**Workflow Structure**

Here's a general workflow structure:

1. **Execute API:** Use the "Execute API" activity to fetch data from your target API.
2. **Create Data Source:**  Use the "Create Data Source" activity to create a new data source from the API response.
3. **Transform Data:** Use activities like "Transform using Javascript" or "Aggregate data by column" to perform calculations on the data.
4. **Output:** Decide how you want to output the results (e.

**Detailed Steps**

1. **Execute API Activity:**

   - **Connection:**  Select the appropriate connection type for your API (e.

   - **Request Type:** Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on the API's requirements.
   - **Request URL:**  Enter the complete API endpoint URL.
   - **Headers:**  Add any necessary headers (e.g., API keys, authentication tokens).
   - **Body:**  If your API requires data to be sent in the request body, paste it here.
   - **Continue Execution on Failure:**  Decide if the workflow should continue even if the API call fails.

2. **Create Data Source Activity:**

   - **Name:** Give your new data source a descriptive name.
   - **Type:** Select "JSON" as the data source type.
   - **Data:**  Paste the JSON response from the API call.
   - **Table Name:**  Choose a name for the table within the data source.

3. **Transform Data:**

   - **Transform using Javascript:** Use JavaScript to perform calculations, manipulate data, or create new columns.
   - **Aggregate data by column:** Group and summarize data based on a column.

4. **Output:**

   - **Send Email:** Send the results as an email.
   - **Upload to Datasource:**  Save the results to a new data source.
   - **Write to file:**  Save the results to a file.
   - **Display:** Show the results in the workflow interface.

**Example Scenario: Weather API**

Let's say you want to get weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and calculate the average temperature over a week.

1. **Execute API:**

   - Connection:  "OpenWeatherMap API"
   - Request Type:  "GET"
   - Request URL:  "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,UK&appid=your_api_key"
   - Headers:  "Authorization: Bearer your_api_key"
   - Body:  ""
2. **Create Data Source:**
   - Name:  "Weather Data"
   - Type:  "JSON"
   - Data:  API response
   - Table Name:  "weather_data"
3. **Transform using Javascript:**
   - Script:  "let totalTemp = 0; let count = 0; for (let i = 0; i < data.list.length; i++) { totalTemp += data.list[i].main.temp; count++; } averageTemp = totalTemp / count; return averageTemp"
4. **Output:**
   - Send Email:  "Weather Report: " + averageTemp + " degrees Celsius"
   - Upload to Datasource:  "Weather Data"
   - Write to file:  "weather_report.txt"

**Remember:**

* Replace placeholders with your actual API key and endpoint.
* Adjust the JavaScript code to your specific needs.
* Explore other activities for more complex calculations.
*  

Let me know if you have a specific API in mind, and I can provide a more tailored example.

[ 2025-07-28 17:05:37,823 ] main.py:341 root - INFO - Here's a breakdown of how to create a workflow in Infoveave to fetch data from an API and then perform calculations on it:

**Workflow Steps**

1. **Execute API Activity:**

   - **Purpose:** This is your starting point. You'll use this activity to connect to your API and retrieve the initial data.
   - **Configuration:**
     - **Connection:** Select the appropriate connection if you've already set up a connection to your API in Infoveave.
     - **Base URL:** Enter the base URL of your API.
     - **Request Type:** Choose the HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) based on your API's requirements.
     - **Headers:**  Add any necessary headers for authentication or data formatting (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type).
     - **Query Parameters:**  Include any parameters needed to refine your API request.
     - **Request Body:** If your API requires data to be sent in the request body (e.g., for POST requests), provide the JSON data here.
     - **Output:** The API response will be stored in the "Data" output of this activity.

2. **Create Datasource:**

   - **Purpose:** Transform the API response into a structured Datasource that you can easily work with for calculations.
   - **Configuration:**
     - **Name:** Give your Datasource a descriptive name.
     - **Type:** Select "Table" as the Datasource type.
     - **Data:**  Paste the "Data" output from the "Execute API" activity.
     - **Schema:**  Infoveave will attempt to automatically detect the schema from the API response. Review and adjust as needed.

3. **Calculation Activities:**

   - **Purpose:** Perform your desired calculations on the data in your Datasource.
   - **Options:** Infoveave offers a wide range of calculation activities:
     - **Aggregate data by column:**  Calculate sums, averages, counts, etc.
     - **Calculate date differences:**  Find the difference between dates.
     - **Text manipulation:** Extract, combine, or transform text.
     - **Numerical formatting:**  Format numbers in specific ways.
     - **Conditional logic:** Use IF statements to apply calculations based on conditions.
     - **Custom functions:**  Write your own functions for complex calculations.

4. **Save Results:**

   - **Purpose:** Store your calculated results.
   - **Options:**
     - **Save to a new Datasource:** Create a new Datasource to store the results.
     - **Update an existing Datasource:** Modify an existing Datasource with your calculations.
     - **Export to file:** Save the results to a file (e.g., CSV, Excel).

**Example Workflow:**

Let's say you want to get data from a weather API and calculate the average temperature over a week.

1. **Execute API:** Fetch weather data for a specific location over a week.
2. **Create Datasource:**  Structure the API response into a table.
3. **Aggregate data by date:** Group by date and calculate the average temperature for each day.
4. **Save to file:** Export the results to a CSV file.



Let me know if you have a specific API in mind, and I can provide a more tailored example.
