    "content": "Introducing Data Quality | Infoveave Help Skip to content Introducing Data Quality Data quality is a measure to check how accurate, complete, consistent, and useful data is for its purpose. Maintaining data quality guarantees high quality data that is reliable and helps businesses make better decisions. It ensures the data is correct, relevant, and ready to be used effectively for analysis, visualization and reporting. Good data quality helps businesses avoid mistakes, improves customer satisfaction, and facilitates efficient operations. On the other hand, poor data quality will lead to wrong conclusions, wasted resources, and poor outcomes. High-quality data is essential for organisations to meet a variety of business requirements, like regulatory compliance, maintaining financial accuracy, enhancing operational efficiency, achieving business growth, improving customer satisfaction among others. Data Quality Dimensions Accuracy Accuracy ensures that the data reflects real-world information and is free of errors such as a customer’s address. Accurate data helps businesses generate dependable insights and enables better decisions. Consistency Consistency ensures that data is uniform across different sources. For example, a customer’s name must be the same in both the billing and CRM systems. Inconsistent data can create confusion and reduce trust. Relevancy Relevancy ensures that the data is appropriate and useful for the specified purpose. Essentially, it’s about having the right data for the right job. Relevant data can streamline operations, improve processes, and ultimately boost organizational performance.  For eg, for a company that wants to improve its marketing strategies, sales data related to customer demographics and purchase history is highly relevant. Completeness Completeness ensures all necessary information is present. For instance, a sales record should include details like the product, customer, and transaction amount. Missing information can make the data less useful and harder to analyze. Validity Validity checks whether the data follows the required rules and formats. For example, dates should be in “YYYY-MM-DD” format, and phone numbers should have the correct number of digits. Invalid data can cause errors and slow down processes. Uniqueness Uniqueness ensures that data is not duplicated. For example, a customer should only have one profile in the system. Duplicate records can be  misleading and lead to incorrect analysis. Timeliness Timeliness ensures that data is up-to-date and available real-time. For example, stock levels in an inventory system should reflect the current quantities. Outdated data can lead to poor decisions and missed opportunities. Integrity Integrity ensures that data relationships are accurate and well maintained across platforms by enforcing strict validation standards. For example, every order should have a valid customer ID that matches an entry in the customer database. Broken links in data can lead to incomplete or incorrect insights."

Variables Infoboard variables are dynamic components that help you define and create custom types of data inputs. You can use these variables in calculated columns for enhanced data analysis, custom calculations, and interactive Infoboards or simulations. Version history The version history feature allows you to view and manage different saved versions of a workflow. You can compare any two versions side by side to identify the changes made. Each version is listed with a timestamp, and you can select, download, or delete a version as needed. View A View in Infoveave works as a custom tooltip that enhances data previews, transforming standard tooltips into dynamic insights. Unlike basic tooltips, a View allows you to use interactive widgets or visualizations for deeper analysis without leaving the page. Viewer A viewer user, is the user with limited access and primarily focuses on reviewing and consuming insights and information. They can view shared Infoboards, explore insights, and review shared elements without the ability to create or modify data sources, Infoboards, or reports. Viewer users are intended for decision-makers who need access to relevant information without the risk of unintended modifications. W Webhook trigger The Webhook trigger allows Workflows to be triggered by HTTP requests sent from external systems. This trigger enables seamless integration with other applications and systems. It allows Workflows to be initiated based on external events or data changes. You can configure the Webhook trigger to listen for specific HTTP requests and trigger the Workflow accordingly. This trigger is useful for building automated Workflows that respond to external events such as data updates or notifications from other systems. What-If Analysis Analysis of a What-If Formulae with applied filters is known as What-If Analysis. You have the ability to adjust or modify the values of the variables used in the What-If Formulae while performing a What-If Analysis. This also allows you to explore a broader range of scenarios by running various analysis conditions. What-If Analysis helps you define and manage the parameters for different scenarios and set alerts. What-If Formulae The What-If Formulae help you explore different scenarios using one or more formulas on measures, expressions, and fixed values. They use the goal-seeking method to provide suggestions. In other words, if you don’t know the input value for an expression but know the desired result, the What-If Formulae suggest inputs to help you achieve it. You can also apply filters to the What-If Formulae based on dimensions available in the Datasource. Widget Configuration The Widget Configuration tab in the Customize panel consists of four sections – Basic, Interactions, Fixed filters, and Linked reports. Widget Customization The Widget Customization tab in Infoveave enables you to tailor the appearance and behavior of widgets to suit your specific data visualization and analysis needs. Widget statistics The Widget statistics feature in Infoveave provides a comprehensive overview of detailed information about your widget activities. This includes the Name, Created by, Infoboards Count, and Infoboards. The feature allows you to apply date range filters to analyze specific periods by selecting start and end dates with granularity options. Workflows Infoveave workflows let you automate and streamline your data processes. These processes range from ingestion to visualization. A workflow is a sequence of connected activities that automates business-critical tasks such as data acquisition, analysis, and reporting. Workflow Alerts Workflow alerts are essential components that help you ensure timely communication, monitor workflow performance, and maintain data integrity in workflows. They ensure timely communication by notifying users of important events through email. Workflow Execution Status The Workflow Execution Status in Infoveave is your go-to resource for monitoring and staying updated on the status of various workflows within the system. It provides valuable information about the status of workflows such as success, failure, or running. You can take relevant actions on a workflow based on its execution status, such as providing corrected data or re-running the workflow. Workflow Start trigger The Workflow Start trigger allows you to start the Workflow manually through an interface. You can upload an array of JSON data or multiple files to initiate a Workflow. This functionality allows you to manually input data or upload files that contain the necessary information to start the Workflow process. Workflow Start triggers are ideal for Workflows that need to be initiated on demand. Workflow Variables Workflow variables are dynamic components that help you define and create custom types of data inputs that you can use in Workflow activities. These variables can hold different types of information such as text, numbers, dates, boolean values, or complex structured data (JSON). They allow you to store and manage data dynamically throughout the execution of Workflow processes."

You can choose to export a workflow with its complete configuration or as a reusable template. The import option allows you to upload existing workflows, making it easier to replicate and reuse processes without rebuilding them from scratch. Exporting a Workflow When you export workflows, you get two options. You can either Export with configuration or Export as a template . Choose one of these options to download your file. Export with configuration Export with configuration keeps all the activity settings and details. When you use this option, nothing is removed — the entire workflow, including all configurations, is saved as it is. Use this when you want to copy or move the exact same workflow to another place. Export as template Export as template removes the activity configurations and only keeps the basic structure of the workflow. This is useful when you want to reuse the workflow layout or steps but set up new configurations later. Importing a Workflow The Import workflow option allows you to bring in existing Workflows from external sources or other systems. When you select this option, you can upload Workflows that have already been created, so you do not have to rebuild them from scratch."

    "content": "SAP | Infoveave Help Skip to content SAP Description The SAP activity enables integration with SAP CRM systems using OData v2 or v4 protocols.\nIt allows workflows to fetch structured business data such as sales orders, customers, or materials from SAP services.. This activity is typically used to fetch master data, transactional records, or business object details from SAP. It supports flexible configuration to connect with various OData services exposed by SAP, such as Sales Orders, Customers, Materials, etc. SAP systems expose data as entities (objects), and each entity can be queried using APIs. This activity supports configuring the object, API version, and additional constraints like result limits. Use case : In a supply chain automation workflow, use the SAP activity to fetch live Sales Order records from the SAP S/4HANA system using OData v4 . The results can then be passed to a downstream Email Sender activity to notify account managers, or to Google Sheet Upload for reporting. Input Data – Optional input used for advanced filtering or parameters (depends on the target API). Output Output Type Format Description Data JSON SAP CRM object data in structured JSON format Configuration Fields Field Name Description Connection Select an existing SAP OData connection. Required for authentication and host resolution. Object Name The name of the SAP object/entity set to fetch. For example: A_SalesOrder , Customer , etc. Api The specific OData endpoint within SAP. Typically maps to a service root path like /sap/opu/odata/sap/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV . Limit (Optional) Maximum number of records to fetch. Prevents over-fetching. ODataVersion Specify the OData version used by the target API. Supported: v2 , v4 . Sample Input Not applicable Sample Configuration Field Value connection.id sap-prod-connection connection.name SAP Production CRM objectName A_SalesOrder api /sap/opu/odata/sap/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV limit 50 odataVersion v4 In this example, the workflow is configured to fetch recent sales orders from an SAP S/4HANA system using the OData v4 protocol: Object Name : A_SalesOrder API Endpoint : /sap/opu/odata/sap/API_SALES_ORDER_SRV OData Version : v4 Limit : 50 This configuration retrieves the 50 most recent Sales Orders from SAP. A downstream StaticLookup or ConditionSwitch activity may route the records based on SalesOrderType (e.g., OR for standard orders) for further processing like sending email alerts or pushing to external systems.

    "content": "DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX | Infoveave Help Skip to content DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX The DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX function in Infoveave calculates the number of unique, distinct values in a column or dataset, while considering a specific condition or criteria defined. It counts how many different items meet the specified condition, excluding rows or items that are blank or empty. Applicable to Calculated Columns Expressions Return Value The return value of the DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX function is an integer representing the count of unique, non-blank values in the specified column or dataset that satisfy the specified condition. Remark DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX is useful when you want to count the number of distinct items in a column or dataset while applying a specific condition or filter. It ensures that only rows or items with meaningful (non-blank) values are considered. DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX function can be used across Date, Strings and Numbers. DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX function takes only all values into account. Syntax DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX(<expression>,<Condition>) DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX in Board Expression Parameter Description Expression A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the actual widget and measure names. Condition A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the condition filter. Widget Name The specific name or identifier of the widget being used for data visualization in the specific Infoboard. Measure Represents the name of the measure that is being displayed or analyzed using the widget. Dimension Represents the dimension column that is being displayed or analyzed using the widget. Dimension Value Represents the specific dimension items within the dimension column used for the visualization in the widget. Steps to Use DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX Write the DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX function. For instance DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX(<expression>,<condition>) Replace <expression> with 'Widget Name'[Measure] and <condition> with [Dimension Name]=\"Dimension Value\" . Replace Widget Name , Measure , Dimension , and Dimension Value with your actual values. Set the DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX function based on the scenario. To learn how to configure an Expression in Infoveave, visit the section Configure Expression . Example Scenario You are managing a dataset and an associated Infoboard named ‘Finance Customers’ within your Finance Management System. Your primary objective is to monitor the eligibility of finance customers for discounts. Specifically, you want to count the number of unique finance customers who belong to either the “Pay on Time” or “No Discount” category. Moreover, you aim to ensure that this count remains less than or equal to 100. If the count of eligible customers drops to 100 or below, you intend to trigger a specific action on your dashboard. Scenario Details Dashboard Name Finance Management Dashboard Widget Name Finance Customers Measure Name Customers (representing the number of customers) Dimension Name Discount Types (categorizing customers based on their payment behavior) Dimension Values “Pay on Time” (customers who pay their bills on time) and “No Discount” (customers not eligible for any discount) Objective Your objective is to count the number of unique solar customers who belong to either the “ Pay on Time ” or “ No Discount ” category, and you want to ensure this count is less than or equal to 100 to trigger a specific action on your dashboard. You can use the DISTINCTCOUNTNONBLANKX function like this DISTINCTCOUNTNONBLANKX('Finance Customers'[Total Customers], [Discount Types] = \"Pay on Time\" OR [Discount Types] = \"No Discount\") <= 100 DISTINCTCOUNTNOBLANKX in Calculated Columns Parameter Description Expression A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the column names. Condition A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the condition filter. Column Name The name of the column in the dataset or Datasource that contains the values you want to analyze.

These variables can hold different types of information such as text, numbers, dates, boolean values, or complex structured data (JSON). They allow you to store and manage data dynamically throughout the execution of Workflow processes. Follow the steps below to define Workflow variables. Navigate to the required Workflow where you want to introduce the variables. Go to the Variables tab to access the variables. This opens the variable modal where you can define and manage your variables. In the variable modal, click on the Add button to start defining a new variable. Provide a descriptive name for your variable. This name should indicate the purpose of the variable. Choose the appropriate type for your variable from the available options. Number for numerical values. String for text-based values. Boolean for true or false values. Date for date values. JSON for structured data in JSON format. Depending on the selected variable type, input the value. For a boolean variable, select either True or False. For a date variable, use the calendar picker to choose a date. For a number variable, enter the numerical value directly. For a string variable, input the desired text. For a JSON variable, enter the JSON structure or array. After defining the variable and its value, click on the Save button to add the variable to your Workflow. To delete a specific variable, click on the associated Delete icon. Using Variables In Workflows, variables enable dynamic configuration of activity parameters. This allows for flexible and reusable automation logic. Instead of entering static values manually, you can reference predefined variables to make your Workflow more adaptable to different contexts or inputs.

These are typically the data points that you want to analyze, such as sales revenue, profit margins, or the number of products sold. Infoveave allows you to create and aggregate measures to perform calculations like sum, average, minimum, maximum, and more. Measures are usually displayed as numeric values in visualizations like charts and tables. To define a measure, follow the steps below. Open the required table in the Datasource Designer . Select the column where you want to add a Measure. Click on the ellipsis icon next to the column. Select the option Add measure from the dropdown. The Add measure modal window appears, allowing you to configure the measure. The Table and Column fields are predefined based on your selection. The Type field is also preselected, aligned with the data type of the chosen column. One of the key components of the Add Measure modal is the Aggregation field. Here, you choose the desired aggregation function for the measure, which determines how values are summarized. Count The total count of values in the column. Sum The summation of numeric values. Average The mean value of numeric data. DistinctCount The count of distinct values. Min The minimum value in the column. Max The maximum value in the column. Configure the properties of the measure to enhance its interpretability and relevance. Prefix A prefix to be added to measure values (optional). Suffix A suffix to be appended to measure values (optional). Measure name Provide a distinctive name for the measure. Format Define the desired display format for measure values. Precision Set the decimal precision for numeric values. Description Elaborate on the purpose and significance of the measure. Click on the Add measure button to finalize the configuration. The created measure becomes available under Measures . Dimensions Dimensions are attributes or categories that help you organize and provide context to the data. These are non-numeric and typically include information like time, geography, product categories, or customer names. In Infoveave, you use dimensions to slice and dice data, allowing you to filter and group data for more meaningful analysis. Dimensions can be hierarchical, such as time with levels like year, quarter, month, and day. To define a dimension, follow the steps below. Open the required table in the Datasource Designer . Select the column where you want to add a Dimension. Click on the ellipsis icon next to the column. Select the option Add dimension from the dropdown. The Add Dimension modal window opens, allowing you to configure the properties of the dimension. The Table , Column , and Type fields are automatically populated based on your selection, which simplifies the configuration process. Configure the following essential fields for your dimension. Dimension name Provide a descriptive name for the dimension to distinguish it from others. Key column Choose the column that contains unique values acting as key identifiers for this dimension. These identifiers enable proper linking and referencing of data across different tables. Order column Optionally specify an order for the values within the dimension. Description Elaborate on the purpose and significance of the dimension. If you want to define a hierarchy within the dimension or establish relationships between tables, you can specify the following. Hierarchy name Define a hierarchy name to organize and structure the dimension. Attribute An attribute represents a specific element or characteristic within a dimension that contributes to its hierarchy. Define the attribute that you want to include in your hierarchy. This could be a subcategory, subgroup, or any other relevant classification within the dimension. Attribute key column For each attribute included in the hierarchy, you need to specify a key column that serves as a link to the related data. This key column provides a reference point for navigating and organizing data within the hierarchy. Attribute name Specify the attribute’s display name. Click on Add attribute to add the hierarchy. Click on the Add dimension button to finalize the configuration of the dimension."

Hierarchies allow you to structure data from a single table into multiple levels, which enables drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis. Relationships define how different data tables are linked. Together, these allow for comprehensive data joining, ensure data integrity, and enable complex analyses across multiple sources. Hierarchies are defined on an identified primary key column for the dimension table. They provide a structured, multi-level view of data, allowing users to drill down into specific details. These are the steps to create hierarchies in Infoveave. Start by selecting the transaction table that you want to work with from Studio Datasources . Make sure it contains the required data for your hierarchy and relationships that includes primary and foreign keys. After selecting the transaction table, click on the Edit icon to enter the Datasource Designer . From the dimension table identify the key column and click on Add dimension . Configure the selected dimension by defining the dimension name, key column, order column, and description . Provide a hierarchy name that reflects its purpose or the data it represents.

    "content": "Introducing Automation | Infoveave Help Skip to content Introducing Automation In today’s data-centric environment, the need for efficient data handling and expedited decision-making is crucial for organizations. Infoveave’s Automation module addresses this demand by providing a versatile platform for designing, building, and deploying automated solutions that streamline data-related processes. This powerful module empowers users to significantly reduce manual effort, connect disparate data sources, and ultimately focus on higher-value strategic activities, driving increased operational efficiency and improved business outcomes. Infoveave’s Automation module offers two key capabilities - Workflow Automation and Web Automation. While both aim to automate tasks, they approach it from different angles and serve distinct purposes. Workflow Automation , at its core, revolves around orchestrating a series of connected Activities . These activities, each representing a specific action like data extraction, transformation, validation, report generation - are linked together to form a Workflow . Infoveave provides a visual, no-code/low-code environment for building these workflows, making it accessible to users regardless of their coding expertise. Workflow Automation excels at automating data pipelines, generating scheduled reports, performing data quality checks, setting up alerts based on data conditions, and integrating Infoveave with other applications. It seamlessly integrates with a wide array of data sources, including spreadsheets, databases, cloud storage, and third-party applications, ensuring a unified view of critical business data. Workflows can be triggered on a schedule, based on specific events, or manually, providing flexibility to adapt to your specific needs. Web Automation , on the other hand, focuses on mimicking human actions within web applications. It involves configuring a “chain of tasks” that simulate how operational users would interact with web applications, such as logging in, navigating menus, entering data, and extracting information. The captured data undergoes validation and transformation based on predefined business rules, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Using Web Automation, the system executes automated tasks, updates relevant systems, generates reports and alerts, freeing business users from routine, repetitive tasks and enabling them to focus on strategic initiatives. In essence, Workflow Automation focuses on orchestrating data-centric tasks and integrating systems, while Web Automation focuses on automating human-like interactions with web applications. Both capabilities complement each other within Infoveave’s Automation module, providing a comprehensive solution for organizations who want to optimize their data workflows, improve efficiency, and drive better business outcomes. Whether you want to automate data entry and validation, provide timely alerts, streamline your billing process, or automate data integration for providing real-time insights, Infoveave’s Automation module offers the necessary tools to achieve them all."

Remark The ROWNUMBERX function returns an integer that represents the row number for rows that meet the specified condition. If any rows do not meet the condition, the ROWNUMBERX function will assign the previous row numbers and continues until the condition is met. If the first row does not meet the condition, the ROWNUMBERX function will assign 0 to the first row and continues until the condition is met. Once the condition is met the ROWNUMBERX function will assign 1 to the row number. Syntax ROWNUMBERX(<expression>,condition) ROWNUMBERX in Calculated Columns Parameter Description Expression A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the column names. Condition A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the condition filter. Column Name The name of the column in the dataset or Datasource that contains the values you want to analyze. Filter Condition A filter condition returns the data points that meet the defined condition that you want to analyze. The filter condition can be either a string or a numeric. Steps to Use Write the ROWNUMBERX function. For instance ROWNUMBERX(<expression>,<condition>) Replace <expression> with required [Column Name] and <condition> equals [Column Name]=\"Filter Condition\" Replace Column Name with the actual name of your column and Filter Condition with the required condition to be applied on the columns. To learn how to add calculated columns in Infoveave, visit the section Calculated Columns under Sources. Example If you have a dataset with sales data and you want to add a row number to each entry where the sales channel is “Online”, you would use the ROWNUMBER function as follows ROWNUMBERX([Priority], [Saleschannel]=\"Online\")"

    "content": "Circular Gauge | Infoveave Help Skip to content Circular Gauge The Circular Gauge Chart is a dialless radial visualization designed to display one or multiple key numeric metrics as concentric progress arcs or rings. Each arc represents a measure’s value relative to its defined minimum and maximum, offering a quick, at-a-glance indication of performance or progress. Unlike classic gauges with pointers or needles, this chart uses a filled radial arc or progress segment that visually encodes the current value as a proportion of its total range. Multiple measures can be displayed simultaneously as stacked or concentric arcs within a single gauge frame. Circular Gauges are especially effective for tracking target-based KPIs , completion percentages, or real-time operational metrics on executive dashboards. Key Features: Displays current value against a defined min/max as a filled progress arc. Supports multiple concentric arcs for comparing several KPIs in one visual. Allows customizable ranges, scale ticks, value labels, and color gradients. Ideal for real-time dashboards, scorecards, and progress tracking. Typical use cases: Showing sales achievement % against monthly or quarterly targets. Monitoring system uptime or SLA adherence. Visualizing budget vs. utilization rates. Displaying order fulfillment progress . Representing metric completions for operational KPIs. ⚙️ Setup Drag the Circular Gauge Chart widget from the chart library onto your designer workspace. Select the chart. Go to the Widget Configuration tab in the Customize panel. Under the Configuration tab, select the Basic Configuration option to access the essential settings for the circular gauge chart. Select the Source which the chart will pull the data from the option.

They enable you to generate custom views of your data using SQL queries on any Datasource within Infoveave. You can update, enrich, or selectively modify your data using different ingestion methods. This provides flexibility in managing data without compromising the structure of your queries. Lists make it easier to handle live data, conduct deeper analysis, and share insights in downloadable formats. Using Infoveave , you can create dynamic lists that reflect live data. You can apply selected dimension filters while creating a list to assist in your analysis. These lists can be downloaded for further examination. It is easy to search for and preview any list you need. You can then download it in formats like CSV or Excel. Creating Lists Infoveave Lists allows you to create and manage a list of selected columns generated through SQL Queries on any Datasource within Infoveave. To create a List in Infoveave using any existing Datasource, click on Studio Lists . All lists created by you or shared with you are displayed under the tabs My Lists and Shared Lists respectively. To create a new list, click on New List . Assign a name to the new list. Select the connection. Select the Key column for the list. Write the query. Validate the list by clicking the Validate button. Select the data ingestion type by clicking the appropriate button. Reload This allows the parent query to reload. It truncates and reloads the existing column data in the list. Insert This option lets you select and insert a sub-query for a parent query using the Insert query field. It allows you to insert new columns into the list without altering the parent query. Upsert This option lets you add a sub-query for a parent query using the Upsert query field. You also have to select a key column to insert and update the list without changing the parent query, using the Select key columns field. To save the list you created, click Save . To view the list, click on the View icon. To know more about viewing list, visit Viewing a list The newly created list is now visible under Studio Lists . Scenarios for Data Ingestion Types You are managing a dataset that stores customer information and purchase records for an e-commerce platform. This dataset contains data on customers, their orders, and their purchase history. You need to create a list to analyze this data more effectively. You have the following options for data ingestion. Reload Suppose you have a parent query that retrieves customer data, including contact information and order history. You want to keep this list updated as new orders and customer details are added. By selecting the Reload option, you can refresh the list. When you choose Reload, Infoveave truncates the existing data in your list and replaces it with the most recent data from the parent query. This ensures that your list always reflects the latest customer and order information. This option is especially useful when your Datasource is frequently updated and you want to maintain a real-time or near real-time view of your data. Insert Suppose you want to enhance your list by adding new columns, such as a Total Purchase Amount column that calculates the sum of purchases for each customer. By choosing the Insert option, you can do this without modifying the original parent query. With the Insert option, you create a sub-query that calculates the Total Purchase Amount and inserts it into the list as a new column. This sub-query works independently, allowing you to enrich your list with additional data while keeping the core customer data query unchanged. It gives you the flexibility to customize your list with calculated fields or data from related sources. Upsert Consider a situation where you need to update specific information in your list. For example, some customers have changed their addresses and you want your list to reflect these updates without reloading all the customer data. By selecting Upsert , you can do this efficiently. With Upsert, you define a sub-query that includes the updated customer addresses. You also specify a key column to identify which customer records need to be updated. Infoveave handles the insertion and update of the data in your list, updating only the records that have changed while preserving the rest. This approach helps you maintain data accuracy without changing the parent query structure. Managing Lists To learn more about managing lists, visit Managing Lists . Downloading Lists from Insights Insights Lists in Infoveave gives you easy access to downloadable data lists. You can quickly find and preview the list you want and download it in formats like CSV or Excel. This helps you simplify data retrieval and use the downloaded data for analysis or sharing.

For instance COUNTNOBLANKX(<expression>,<condition>) Where expression equals 'Widget Name'[Measure] and condition equals [Dimension Name]=\"Dimension Value\" .Replace Widget Name with the actual name of your widget, Measure with the required measure name, Dimension with the required dimension name and Dimension Value with the dimension value of the selected dimension name. Set the COUNTNOBLANKX function based on the scenario. To learn how to configure an Expression in Infoveave, visit the section Configure Expression . Example Scenario You’re managing a dynamic dataset and an associated Infoboard named ‘Finance Analytics’ within your Financial Analytics System. Your mission is to count the number of rows where customers simultaneously qualify for two distinct discount categories- “Early Payment” and “No Discount.” This is a crucial activity for cost analysis and customer segmentation. Scenario Details Dashboard Name Finance Analytics Dashboard Widget Name Finance Data Overview Measure Name Total Customers (representing the number of customers) Dimension Name Discount Types (categorizing customers based on their payment behavior) Dimension Values “Early Payment” (customers who pay their bills early) and “No Discount” (customers not eligible for any discount) Objective Your objective is to count the number of rows where customers fall into specific discount categories, such as “Early Payment” and “No Discount,” and determine if this count is equal to 20. If this condition is met, you want to trigger a particular action on your dashboard. You can use the COUNTNOBLANKX function like this COUNTNOBLANKX('Finance Data Overview'[Total Customers], [Discount Types] = \"Early Payment\" AND [Discount Types] =\"No Discount\") = 20 COUNTNOBLANKX in Calculated Columns Parameters Expression A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the column name. Condition A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the condition filter. Column Name The name of the column in the dataset or Datasource that contains the values you want to analyze. Filter Condition A filter condition returns the data points that meet the defined condition that you want to analyze. The filter condition can be either a string or a numeric. Steps to use COUNTNOBLANKX in Calculated Columns Write the COUNTNOBLANKX function. For instance COUNTNOBLANKX(<expression>,<condition>) Replace <expression> with required [Column Name] and <condition> equals [Column Name]=\"Filter Condition\" Replace Column Name with the actual name of your column and Filter Condition with the required condition to be applied on the columns. To learn how to add calculated columns in Infoveave, visit the section Calculated Columns . Example Objective Consider that you have the below sales dataset, your goal is to identify the rows in the dataset where ORDER PRIORITY is Low and [DEALER]= Hirthe and Sons, then they should be eligible for a discount. SHIP DATE ORDER PRIORITY DEALER PACKET ID SHIPPING QUANTITY INVOICE PRICE LOCATION 05-05-2024 Low Hirthe and Sons 10048 3 28.65875 KL 10-05-2024 Low Hirthe and Sons 10063 1 36.89025 TN 15-05-2024 Medium Sipes Group 10069 3 28.65875 TN 20-05-2024 High Sipes Group 10063 5 25.553 KL 25-05-2024 High Miller Inc 10089 5 25.553 TK You can use the COUNTNOBLANKX function like COUNTNOBLANKX([DEALER],[ORDER PRIORITY]=\"Low\" AND [DEALER]=\"Hirthe and Sons\") The new calculated column will return the value as 2 . SHIP DATE ORDER PRIORITY DEALER PACKET ID SHIPPING QUANTITY INVOICE PRICE LOCATION Eligible 05-05-2024 Low Hirthe and Sons 10048 3 28.65875 KL 2 10-05-2024 Low Hirthe and Sons 10063 1 36.89025 TN 2 15-05-2024 Medium Sipes Group 10069 3 28.65875 TN 2 20-05-2024 High Sipes Group 10063 5 25.553 KL 2 25-05-2024 High Miller Inc 10089 5 25.553 TK 2"

    "content": "Calculated Columns | Infoveave Help Skip to content Calculated Columns Calculated columns in Infoveave allow you to create new data columns based on existing data. By using JavaScript, you can perform complex transformations and clean column values directly within Infoveave. This enables you to manipulate and refine your data to meet specific analysis requirements. Configuring Calculated Columns Here is a step-by-step guide to configure calculated columns in Infoveave. Open the required table in the Datasource Designer . Choose the data table where you want to add a calculated column. Click on the Add calculated column icon at the top of the data table. The Add calculated column module will open. Enter a name for the calculated column. Select the appropriate column type. Enter the required formula or JavaScript code. Use (@) to refer to a column from the source. Click on Validate to preview the new column. Check the Recalculate on add option for the table to instantly validate the expression and add values to the new column. Enabling this checkbox avoids the need to reupload the data to populate the calculated column. Click on Add column to finalize and add the calculated column to your data table. Scenarios Change Column Format In data analysis, it is often necessary to change the format of a column to meet specific requirements or conform to certain rules. With Infoveave, you can easily do this using calculated columns and custom JavaScript to transform data. In this tutorial, you learn how to add an alphabet as a prefix to numeric values in a column. Example Consider a dataset containing sales information, including a Customer ID column with numeric values representing unique customer identifiers. In this example, you add the alphabet A to each Customer ID value to create a new identifier format. JavaScript Code let customerID = @ Customer ID ; // Get the value of the Customer ID column let newCustomerID = ' A ' + customerID . toString (); // Concatenate 'A' with the Customer ID and convert to string newCustomerID ; // Return the new Customer ID Replace Nulls During data preparation for analysis, you may encounter missing or null values that can impact the accuracy of your insights. Addressing these gaps is essential for meaningful analysis. Infoveave provides tools to efficiently handle such scenarios. In this tutorial, you explore how to replace null values with a specified text, such as Not available , using calculated columns in Infoveave. Example Consider a dataset containing customer information where some fields may have missing values. Focus on the Age column and replace null values with Not available . JavaScript Code let age = @ Age ; // Replace 'Age' with the actual column name if ( age === null || age === \"\" ) { age = \" Not available \" ; // Replace null or empty values with \"Not available\" } age ; // Return the modified value Replace Column Values You may need to modify specific values in your dataset to reflect updated information or new business requirements. With Infoveave’s calculated columns feature, you can achieve this easily by applying custom JavaScript code to manipulate your data. In this tutorial, you learn how to replace specific values in a column. Use an example dataset where you update the dealer name Sipes Group to New Spkies due to a recent company merger. Example Consider a dataset containing dealer information where some fields may contain incorrect values. Focus on the Dealer Name column and replace Sipes Group with New Spkies . JavaScript Code let dealerName = @ Dealer Name ; // Access the value of the \"Dealer Name\" column // Check if the dealerName is \"Sipes Group\", replace with \"New Spkies\", else keep the original value if ( dealerName === \" Sipes Group \" ) { dealerName = \" New Spkies \" ; } dealerName ; // Return the modified value Remove Timestamps from Date Columns In data analysis, it is common that the date columns contain timestamps. In certain cases, you may need to remove the time stamp analysis or visualization. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to remove timestamps from date columns using Infoveave’s calculated columns feature. We will use an example dataset containing order information with timestamps and show how to extract and format the date portion only. Example Consider a dataset containing order information with timestamps in the “Order Date” column. We want to remove the timestamps and display only the date portion. JavaScript Code var time = @ Order Date ; var newTime = time ? time . split ( \" \" )[ 0 ] : new Date () . toISOString () . split ( \" T \" )[ 0 ]; var parts = newTime . split ( \" - \" ); var formattedDate = parts [ 2 ] + \" - \" + parts [ 1 ] + \" - \" + parts [ 0 ]; formattedDate ; Add Conditional Filters Filtering data based on specific conditions is a common task in data analysis to focus on relevant subsets of data. With Infoveave, you can implement conditional filters using JavaScript code within calculated columns. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a conditional filter to select rows based on a specific condition. Use an example of filtering customers older than 30 years from the dataset. Example Consider a dataset containing employee information with columns for Employee Name and Age . You want to filter out employees who are older than 30 years. JavaScript Code var age = @ Age ; if ( age && age <= 30 ) { true ; } else { false ; }"

    "content": "Introducing Automation | Infoveave Help Skip to content Introducing Automation In today’s data-centric environment, the need for efficient data handling and expedited decision-making is crucial for organizations. Infoveave’s Automation module addresses this demand by providing a versatile platform for designing, building, and deploying automated solutions that streamline data-related processes. This powerful module empowers users to significantly reduce manual effort, connect disparate data sources, and ultimately focus on higher-value strategic activities, driving increased operational efficiency and improved business outcomes. Infoveave’s Automation module offers two key capabilities - Workflow Automation and Web Automation. While both aim to automate tasks, they approach it from different angles and serve distinct purposes. Workflow Automation , at its core, revolves around orchestrating a series of connected Activities . These activities, each representing a specific action like data extraction, transformation, validation, report generation - are linked together to form a Workflow . Infoveave provides a visual, no-code/low-code environment for building these workflows, making it accessible to users regardless of their coding expertise. Workflow Automation excels at automating data pipelines, generating scheduled reports, performing data quality checks, setting up alerts based on data conditions, and integrating Infoveave with other applications. It seamlessly integrates with a wide array of data sources, including spreadsheets, databases, cloud storage, and third-party applications, ensuring a unified view of critical business data. Workflows can be triggered on a schedule, based on specific events, or manually, providing flexibility to adapt to your specific needs. Web Automation , on the other hand, focuses on mimicking human actions within web applications. It involves configuring a “chain of tasks” that simulate how operational users would interact with web applications, such as logging in, navigating menus, entering data, and extracting information. The captured data undergoes validation and transformation based on predefined business rules, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Using Web Automation, the system executes automated tasks, updates relevant systems, generates reports and alerts, freeing business users from routine, repetitive tasks and enabling them to focus on strategic initiatives. In essence, Workflow Automation focuses on orchestrating data-centric tasks and integrating systems, while Web Automation focuses on automating human-like interactions with web applications. Both capabilities complement each other within Infoveave’s Automation module, providing a comprehensive solution for organizations who want to optimize their data workflows, improve efficiency, and drive better business outcomes. Whether you want to automate data entry and validation, provide timely alerts, streamline your billing process, or automate data integration for providing real-time insights, Infoveave’s Automation module offers the necessary tools to achieve them all."

This activity plays a crucial role in data cleansing, monitoring, auditing, and reporting workflows by enabling users to focus only on records that did not meet predefined data quality standards. You begin by selecting an existing Data Quality configuration ( Data Quality ) that was already executed. Then, you specify one or more Data Quality Rules ( Data Quality Rule ) from that configuration. The activity will filter and return only those rows from the validated dataset that failed the selected rules. This output allows data engineers, analysts, or business users to identify bad data that violates conditions such as missing values ( Not Null Check ), incorrect formats ( Pattern Matching , Email Validation ), duplicates ( Column Uniqueness ), and more. The returned data includes not only the invalid rows but also the specific rule each row failed , which helps in pinpointing the exact issue. This activity is especially useful in data pipelines where maintaining data trustworthiness is vital before passing data downstream. Failed records can be: Reviewed by business users to understand the nature of the errors. Exported or reported to relevant stakeholders or teams responsible for data input. Corrected manually or sent into a remediation workflow. Used for rule refinement , helping to enhance rule definitions or thresholds based on recurring error trends. Example Use Case : If a Sales dataset contains records with missing Email or invalid Phone Number formats, executing this activity with those rule filters will extract only the rows with issues. This data can be reviewed for correction before proceeding with customer communications or analytics. Ultimately, this activity acts as a diagnostic tool for highlighting low-quality data and enables organizations to improve data hygiene continuously. It ensures data quality compliance by offering transparency into exactly which records are problematic and why — leading to better data governance, operational efficiency, and trust in analytics.

    "content": "Calculated Columns | Infoveave Help Skip to content Calculated Columns Calculated columns in Infoveave allow you to create new data columns based on existing data. By using JavaScript, you can perform complex transformations and clean column values directly within Infoveave. This enables you to manipulate and refine your data to meet specific analysis requirements. Configuring Calculated Columns Here is a step-by-step guide to configure calculated columns in Infoveave. Open the required table in the Datasource Designer . Choose the data table where you want to add a calculated column. Click on the Add calculated column icon at the top of the data table. The Add calculated column module will open. Enter a name for the calculated column. Select the appropriate column type. Enter the required formula or JavaScript code. Use (@) to refer to a column from the source. Click on Validate to preview the new column. Check the Recalculate on add option for the table to instantly validate the expression and add values to the new column. Enabling this checkbox avoids the need to reupload the data to populate the calculated column. Click on Add column to finalize and add the calculated column to your data table. Scenarios Change Column Format In data analysis, it is often necessary to change the format of a column to meet specific requirements or conform to certain rules. With Infoveave, you can easily do this using calculated columns and custom JavaScript to transform data. In this tutorial, you learn how to add an alphabet as a prefix to numeric values in a column. Example Consider a dataset containing sales information, including a Customer ID column with numeric values representing unique customer identifiers. In this example, you add the alphabet A to each Customer ID value to create a new identifier format. JavaScript Code let customerID = @ Customer ID ; // Get the value of the Customer ID column let newCustomerID = ' A ' + customerID . toString (); // Concatenate 'A' with the Customer ID and convert to string newCustomerID ; // Return the new Customer ID Replace Nulls During data preparation for analysis, you may encounter missing or null values that can impact the accuracy of your insights. Addressing these gaps is essential for meaningful analysis. Infoveave provides tools to efficiently handle such scenarios. In this tutorial, you explore how to replace null values with a specified text, such as Not available , using calculated columns in Infoveave. Example Consider a dataset containing customer information where some fields may have missing values. Focus on the Age column and replace null values with Not available . JavaScript Code let age = @ Age ; // Replace 'Age' with the actual column name if ( age === null || age === \"\" ) { age = \" Not available \" ; // Replace null or empty values with \"Not available\" } age ; // Return the modified value Replace Column Values You may need to modify specific values in your dataset to reflect updated information or new business requirements. With Infoveave’s calculated columns feature, you can achieve this easily by applying custom JavaScript code to manipulate your data. In this tutorial, you learn how to replace specific values in a column. Use an example dataset where you update the dealer name Sipes Group to New Spkies due to a recent company merger. Example Consider a dataset containing dealer information where some fields may contain incorrect values. Focus on the Dealer Name column and replace Sipes Group with New Spkies . JavaScript Code let dealerName = @ Dealer Name ; // Access the value of the \"Dealer Name\" column // Check if the dealerName is \"Sipes Group\", replace with \"New Spkies\", else keep the original value if ( dealerName === \" Sipes Group \" ) { dealerName = \" New Spkies \" ; } dealerName ; // Return the modified value Remove Timestamps from Date Columns In data analysis, it is common that the date columns contain timestamps. In certain cases, you may need to remove the time stamp analysis or visualization. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to remove timestamps from date columns using Infoveave’s calculated columns feature. We will use an example dataset containing order information with timestamps and show how to extract and format the date portion only. Example Consider a dataset containing order information with timestamps in the “Order Date” column. We want to remove the timestamps and display only the date portion. JavaScript Code var time = @ Order Date ; var newTime = time ? time . split ( \" \" )[ 0 ] : new Date () . toISOString () . split ( \" T \" )[ 0 ]; var parts = newTime . split ( \" - \" ); var formattedDate = parts [ 2 ] + \" - \" + parts [ 1 ] + \" - \" + parts [ 0 ]; formattedDate ; Add Conditional Filters Filtering data based on specific conditions is a common task in data analysis to focus on relevant subsets of data. With Infoveave, you can implement conditional filters using JavaScript code within calculated columns. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a conditional filter to select rows based on a specific condition. Use an example of filtering customers older than 30 years from the dataset. Example Consider a dataset containing employee information with columns for Employee Name and Age . You want to filter out employees who are older than 30 years. JavaScript Code var age = @ Age ; if ( age && age <= 30 ) { true ; } else { false ; }"

Choose At if you want to schedule the Workflow at a specific time such as 6:30. Select the desired hour and minute from the drop-down lists. Choose Custom if you want to schedule the Workflow at a custom time. Select the time zone from the drop-down list. Choose the days on which you want to execute the Workflow. By default, Infoveave sets it to every day. You can select specific days of the week, days of the month, or months. Click on the Add button to set the schedule for Workflow execution. The scheduled times will be displayed in a tabular form. To Delete a scheduled time, click on the delete icon associated with that schedule. Webhook trigger The Webhook trigger allows Workflows to be triggered by HTTP requests sent from external systems. This trigger enables seamless integration with other applications and systems. It allows Workflows to be initiated based on external events or data changes. You can configure the Webhook trigger to listen for specific HTTP requests and trigger the Workflow accordingly. This trigger is useful for building automated Workflows that respond to external events such as data updates or notifications from other systems. To trigger Workflow automation using the Webhook, follow the steps below. Select the Webhook trigger icon in the Workflow start. Click on the Add button to start adding the Webhook trigger. Enter a Name for the Webhook. Define the URL Endpoint in the URL string. Click on the Save icon to save the configuration. Mouse over the added URL to get the full URL. This will be used for the HTTP post request for the external trigger. Emailhook trigger The Emailhook trigger initiates the Workflow based on incoming emails. You can set up specific email addresses. This allows for automated processing of email-based activities or notifications. This trigger is useful for Workflows that involve email notifications or processing of data received via email. To set up an Emailhook trigger for the Workflow, follow the steps below. Select the Emailhook trigger icon. Click on the Add button to add the email address.

    "content": "Calculated Columns | Infoveave Help Skip to content Calculated Columns Calculated columns in Infoveave allow you to create new data columns based on existing data. By using JavaScript, you can perform complex transformations and clean column values directly within Infoveave. This enables you to manipulate and refine your data to meet specific analysis requirements. Configuring Calculated Columns Here is a step-by-step guide to configure calculated columns in Infoveave. Open the required table in the Datasource Designer . Choose the data table where you want to add a calculated column. Click on the Add calculated column icon at the top of the data table. The Add calculated column module will open. Enter a name for the calculated column. Select the appropriate column type. Enter the required formula or JavaScript code. Use (@) to refer to a column from the source. Click on Validate to preview the new column. Check the Recalculate on add option for the table to instantly validate the expression and add values to the new column. Enabling this checkbox avoids the need to reupload the data to populate the calculated column. Click on Add column to finalize and add the calculated column to your data table. Scenarios Change Column Format In data analysis, it is often necessary to change the format of a column to meet specific requirements or conform to certain rules. With Infoveave, you can easily do this using calculated columns and custom JavaScript to transform data. In this tutorial, you learn how to add an alphabet as a prefix to numeric values in a column. Example Consider a dataset containing sales information, including a Customer ID column with numeric values representing unique customer identifiers. In this example, you add the alphabet A to each Customer ID value to create a new identifier format. JavaScript Code let customerID = @ Customer ID ; // Get the value of the Customer ID column let newCustomerID = ' A ' + customerID . toString (); // Concatenate 'A' with the Customer ID and convert to string newCustomerID ; // Return the new Customer ID Replace Nulls During data preparation for analysis, you may encounter missing or null values that can impact the accuracy of your insights. Addressing these gaps is essential for meaningful analysis. Infoveave provides tools to efficiently handle such scenarios. In this tutorial, you explore how to replace null values with a specified text, such as Not available , using calculated columns in Infoveave. Example Consider a dataset containing customer information where some fields may have missing values. Focus on the Age column and replace null values with Not available . JavaScript Code let age = @ Age ; // Replace 'Age' with the actual column name if ( age === null || age === \"\" ) { age = \" Not available \" ; // Replace null or empty values with \"Not available\" } age ; // Return the modified value Replace Column Values You may need to modify specific values in your dataset to reflect updated information or new business requirements. With Infoveave’s calculated columns feature, you can achieve this easily by applying custom JavaScript code to manipulate your data. In this tutorial, you learn how to replace specific values in a column. Use an example dataset where you update the dealer name Sipes Group to New Spkies due to a recent company merger. Example Consider a dataset containing dealer information where some fields may contain incorrect values. Focus on the Dealer Name column and replace Sipes Group with New Spkies . JavaScript Code let dealerName = @ Dealer Name ; // Access the value of the \"Dealer Name\" column // Check if the dealerName is \"Sipes Group\", replace with \"New Spkies\", else keep the original value if ( dealerName === \" Sipes Group \" ) { dealerName = \" New Spkies \" ; } dealerName ; // Return the modified value Remove Timestamps from Date Columns In data analysis, it is common that the date columns contain timestamps. In certain cases, you may need to remove the time stamp analysis or visualization. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to remove timestamps from date columns using Infoveave’s calculated columns feature. We will use an example dataset containing order information with timestamps and show how to extract and format the date portion only. Example Consider a dataset containing order information with timestamps in the “Order Date” column. We want to remove the timestamps and display only the date portion. JavaScript Code var time = @ Order Date ; var newTime = time ? time . split ( \" \" )[ 0 ] : new Date () . toISOString () . split ( \" T \" )[ 0 ]; var parts = newTime . split ( \" - \" ); var formattedDate = parts [ 2 ] + \" - \" + parts [ 1 ] + \" - \" + parts [ 0 ]; formattedDate ; Add Conditional Filters Filtering data based on specific conditions is a common task in data analysis to focus on relevant subsets of data. With Infoveave, you can implement conditional filters using JavaScript code within calculated columns. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a conditional filter to select rows based on a specific condition. Use an example of filtering customers older than 30 years from the dataset. Example Consider a dataset containing employee information with columns for Employee Name and Age . You want to filter out employees who are older than 30 years. JavaScript Code var age = @ Age ; if ( age && age <= 30 ) { true ; } else { false ; }"

    "content": "Calculated Columns | Infoveave Help Skip to content Calculated Columns Calculated columns in Infoveave allow you to create new data columns based on existing data. By using JavaScript, you can perform complex transformations and clean column values directly within Infoveave. This enables you to manipulate and refine your data to meet specific analysis requirements. Configuring Calculated Columns Here is a step-by-step guide to configure calculated columns in Infoveave. Open the required table in the Datasource Designer . Choose the data table where you want to add a calculated column. Click on the Add calculated column icon at the top of the data table. The Add calculated column module will open. Enter a name for the calculated column. Select the appropriate column type. Enter the required formula or JavaScript code. Use (@) to refer to a column from the source. Click on Validate to preview the new column. Check the Recalculate on add option for the table to instantly validate the expression and add values to the new column. Enabling this checkbox avoids the need to reupload the data to populate the calculated column. Click on Add column to finalize and add the calculated column to your data table. Scenarios Change Column Format In data analysis, it is often necessary to change the format of a column to meet specific requirements or conform to certain rules. With Infoveave, you can easily do this using calculated columns and custom JavaScript to transform data. In this tutorial, you learn how to add an alphabet as a prefix to numeric values in a column. Example Consider a dataset containing sales information, including a Customer ID column with numeric values representing unique customer identifiers. In this example, you add the alphabet A to each Customer ID value to create a new identifier format. JavaScript Code let customerID = @ Customer ID ; // Get the value of the Customer ID column let newCustomerID = ' A ' + customerID . toString (); // Concatenate 'A' with the Customer ID and convert to string newCustomerID ; // Return the new Customer ID Replace Nulls During data preparation for analysis, you may encounter missing or null values that can impact the accuracy of your insights. Addressing these gaps is essential for meaningful analysis. Infoveave provides tools to efficiently handle such scenarios. In this tutorial, you explore how to replace null values with a specified text, such as Not available , using calculated columns in Infoveave. Example Consider a dataset containing customer information where some fields may have missing values. Focus on the Age column and replace null values with Not available . JavaScript Code let age = @ Age ; // Replace 'Age' with the actual column name if ( age === null || age === \"\" ) { age = \" Not available \" ; // Replace null or empty values with \"Not available\" } age ; // Return the modified value Replace Column Values You may need to modify specific values in your dataset to reflect updated information or new business requirements. With Infoveave’s calculated columns feature, you can achieve this easily by applying custom JavaScript code to manipulate your data. In this tutorial, you learn how to replace specific values in a column. Use an example dataset where you update the dealer name Sipes Group to New Spkies due to a recent company merger. Example Consider a dataset containing dealer information where some fields may contain incorrect values. Focus on the Dealer Name column and replace Sipes Group with New Spkies . JavaScript Code let dealerName = @ Dealer Name ; // Access the value of the \"Dealer Name\" column // Check if the dealerName is \"Sipes Group\", replace with \"New Spkies\", else keep the original value if ( dealerName === \" Sipes Group \" ) { dealerName = \" New Spkies \" ; } dealerName ; // Return the modified value Remove Timestamps from Date Columns In data analysis, it is common that the date columns contain timestamps. In certain cases, you may need to remove the time stamp analysis or visualization. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to remove timestamps from date columns using Infoveave’s calculated columns feature. We will use an example dataset containing order information with timestamps and show how to extract and format the date portion only. Example Consider a dataset containing order information with timestamps in the “Order Date” column. We want to remove the timestamps and display only the date portion. JavaScript Code var time = @ Order Date ; var newTime = time ? time . split ( \" \" )[ 0 ] : new Date () . toISOString () . split ( \" T \" )[ 0 ]; var parts = newTime . split ( \" - \" ); var formattedDate = parts [ 2 ] + \" - \" + parts [ 1 ] + \" - \" + parts [ 0 ]; formattedDate ; Add Conditional Filters Filtering data based on specific conditions is a common task in data analysis to focus on relevant subsets of data. With Infoveave, you can implement conditional filters using JavaScript code within calculated columns. This tutorial demonstrates how to create a conditional filter to select rows based on a specific condition. Use an example of filtering customers older than 30 years from the dataset. Example Consider a dataset containing employee information with columns for Employee Name and Age . You want to filter out employees who are older than 30 years. JavaScript Code var age = @ Age ; if ( age && age <= 30 ) { true ; } else { false ; }"

A Target enables you to visualize the difference between the desired score and the actual measure of an indicator on a certain date. Thresholds define a normal range of measures for an indicator and alert you when specific events occur, such as when a measure reaches an all-time high or low. Creating Targets and Thresholds To create and set up a Target and Threshold based on your available Datasource, click on Automation Target and Thresholds . All Targets and Thresholds created by you or shared with you are displayed under the tabs My Targets and Thresholds and Shared Targets and Thresholds respectively. To define a new formula, click on New Target and Threshold . Enter the Target and Threshold Name . Selecting Datasource, Measures & Dimensions Select the Datasource, associated measures, and dimensions for your Target and Threshold. This helps you align the Alerts with your requirements. Select the Datasource you want to use from the drop-down list. Select the required Measures and Dimensions from their respective lists. Select the alert frequency for the date dimension. You can choose from years, quarters, months, weeks, or days. After configuring all measures and dimensions, define their aggregation type as either sum or average. Click on Save to save the Target and Threshold configuration. By default, Infoveave creates four alerts for each Target and Threshold. Click on the alert icon of the Target and Threshold to view these alerts. You need to configure these alerts with the correct target and threshold levels so they can be triggered. To do this, you must provide values for each target and threshold based on the defined frequency and dimension values using the provided template. Downloading the Target and Threshold Template The Target and Threshold template provides a framework for setting the target and threshold values. After downloading the template, you can define your target and threshold values before uploading them back into Infoveave. You can select the required frequency and dimension values while downloading. To define the target and threshold values, start by downloading the template. Click on the Download icon for the required Target and Threshold under Automation Target and Thresholds . The download template dialog box appears showing the selected dimension values. Select the date range based on the frequency you want. Choose between Percentage or Value of the target based on the type of value you want to insert in the template. Select the dimension items for each dimension on which you want to apply the targets and thresholds. If you want to select all available dimension values, use the Select All option. Click on the Download button to download the template in .csv format. Open the downloaded template and define the targets and three threshold values as required. Ideally, the threshold values must be represented as “Below,” “Average,” and “Above,” corresponding to Threshold1, Threshold2, and Threshold3. However, you can define them as required for your business scenario. Uploading the Target and Threshold Template Uploading the Target and Threshold template into Infoveave allows you to apply the configured targets and thresholds. Click on the Upload Template icon to begin. The upload template dialog box appears for you to upload the configured template. Browse your local storage and select the template file you created earlier. Confirm the upload by clicking on the Data Upload button. You receive a success notification once the template is uploaded. To verify the uploaded template and ensure it accurately reflects your target and threshold values, click on the Edit Target and Threshold option.

    "content": "Introducing Data Quality | Infoveave Help Skip to content Introducing Data Quality Data quality is a measure to check how accurate, complete, consistent, and useful data is for its purpose. Maintaining data quality guarantees high quality data that is reliable and helps businesses make better decisions. It ensures the data is correct, relevant, and ready to be used effectively for analysis, visualization and reporting. Good data quality helps businesses avoid mistakes, improves customer satisfaction, and facilitates efficient operations. On the other hand, poor data quality will lead to wrong conclusions, wasted resources, and poor outcomes. High-quality data is essential for organisations to meet a variety of business requirements, like regulatory compliance, maintaining financial accuracy, enhancing operational efficiency, achieving business growth, improving customer satisfaction among others. Data Quality Dimensions Accuracy Accuracy ensures that the data reflects real-world information and is free of errors such as a customer’s address. Accurate data helps businesses generate dependable insights and enables better decisions. Consistency Consistency ensures that data is uniform across different sources. For example, a customer’s name must be the same in both the billing and CRM systems. Inconsistent data can create confusion and reduce trust. Relevancy Relevancy ensures that the data is appropriate and useful for the specified purpose. Essentially, it’s about having the right data for the right job. Relevant data can streamline operations, improve processes, and ultimately boost organizational performance.  For eg, for a company that wants to improve its marketing strategies, sales data related to customer demographics and purchase history is highly relevant. Completeness Completeness ensures all necessary information is present. For instance, a sales record should include details like the product, customer, and transaction amount. Missing information can make the data less useful and harder to analyze. Validity Validity checks whether the data follows the required rules and formats. For example, dates should be in “YYYY-MM-DD” format, and phone numbers should have the correct number of digits. Invalid data can cause errors and slow down processes. Uniqueness Uniqueness ensures that data is not duplicated. For example, a customer should only have one profile in the system. Duplicate records can be  misleading and lead to incorrect analysis. Timeliness Timeliness ensures that data is up-to-date and available real-time. For example, stock levels in an inventory system should reflect the current quantities. Outdated data can lead to poor decisions and missed opportunities. Integrity Integrity ensures that data relationships are accurate and well maintained across platforms by enforcing strict validation standards. For example, every order should have a valid customer ID that matches an entry in the customer database. Broken links in data can lead to incomplete or incorrect insights."

They enable you to generate custom views of your data using SQL queries on any Datasource within Infoveave. You can update, enrich, or selectively modify your data using different ingestion methods. This provides flexibility in managing data without compromising the structure of your queries. Lists make it easier to handle live data, conduct deeper analysis, and share insights in downloadable formats. Using Infoveave , you can create dynamic lists that reflect live data. You can apply selected dimension filters while creating a list to assist in your analysis. These lists can be downloaded for further examination. It is easy to search for and preview any list you need. You can then download it in formats like CSV or Excel. Creating Lists Infoveave Lists allows you to create and manage a list of selected columns generated through SQL Queries on any Datasource within Infoveave. To create a List in Infoveave using any existing Datasource, click on Studio Lists . All lists created by you or shared with you are displayed under the tabs My Lists and Shared Lists respectively. To create a new list, click on New List . Assign a name to the new list. Select the connection. Select the Key column for the list. Write the query. Validate the list by clicking the Validate button. Select the data ingestion type by clicking the appropriate button. Reload This allows the parent query to reload. It truncates and reloads the existing column data in the list. Insert This option lets you select and insert a sub-query for a parent query using the Insert query field. It allows you to insert new columns into the list without altering the parent query. Upsert This option lets you add a sub-query for a parent query using the Upsert query field. You also have to select a key column to insert and update the list without changing the parent query, using the Select key columns field. To save the list you created, click Save . To view the list, click on the View icon. To know more about viewing list, visit Viewing a list The newly created list is now visible under Studio Lists . Scenarios for Data Ingestion Types You are managing a dataset that stores customer information and purchase records for an e-commerce platform. This dataset contains data on customers, their orders, and their purchase history. You need to create a list to analyze this data more effectively. You have the following options for data ingestion. Reload Suppose you have a parent query that retrieves customer data, including contact information and order history. You want to keep this list updated as new orders and customer details are added. By selecting the Reload option, you can refresh the list. When you choose Reload, Infoveave truncates the existing data in your list and replaces it with the most recent data from the parent query. This ensures that your list always reflects the latest customer and order information. This option is especially useful when your Datasource is frequently updated and you want to maintain a real-time or near real-time view of your data. Insert Suppose you want to enhance your list by adding new columns, such as a Total Purchase Amount column that calculates the sum of purchases for each customer. By choosing the Insert option, you can do this without modifying the original parent query. With the Insert option, you create a sub-query that calculates the Total Purchase Amount and inserts it into the list as a new column. This sub-query works independently, allowing you to enrich your list with additional data while keeping the core customer data query unchanged. It gives you the flexibility to customize your list with calculated fields or data from related sources. Upsert Consider a situation where you need to update specific information in your list. For example, some customers have changed their addresses and you want your list to reflect these updates without reloading all the customer data. By selecting Upsert , you can do this efficiently. With Upsert, you define a sub-query that includes the updated customer addresses. You also specify a key column to identify which customer records need to be updated. Infoveave handles the insertion and update of the data in your list, updating only the records that have changed while preserving the rest. This approach helps you maintain data accuracy without changing the parent query structure. Managing Lists To learn more about managing lists, visit Managing Lists . Downloading Lists from Insights Insights Lists in Infoveave gives you easy access to downloadable data lists. You can quickly find and preview the list you want and download it in formats like CSV or Excel. This helps you simplify data retrieval and use the downloaded data for analysis or sharing. Click on the Insights section in the Infoveave menu. In the Insights layout, find the Lists option. Browse through the lists or use the search bar for quick access. After you find the list you want, click on it to open the list details. You are redirected to the List View. In the List View, you can preview the contents of the list including the data and columns.

    "content": "Numerical Binning | Infoveave Help Skip to content Numerical Binning Description The Numerical Binning activity transforms continuous numeric data into discrete intervals or “bins” using statistical or custom-defined rules. This technique is useful in data preprocessing, reporting, and visualization, where numeric precision can be generalized for pattern discovery or grouping. Binning reduces complexity in datasets by segmenting a continuous range of values into a finite number of intervals. These intervals can be computed automatically using statistical rules or configured manually by specifying bin sizes and value ranges. Use this activity to: Convert continuous data into categorized groups Preprocess numerical columns for ML models or dashboards Highlight distribution patterns in reporting and visualization Simplify data when precision is unnecessary Use case :\nWhen analyzing customer age distributions, binning age into ranges such as “20–30”, “30–40”, and so on helps simplify reports. This transformation can be useful for segmentation in sales, surveys, or behavioral analytics. Input Type Status Description Data Required A dataset that includes at least one column containing numerical values to be binned. Output Output Type Format Description Data Table Transformed dataset with a new column containing bin labels. Configuration Fields Field Name Description Column Select the column that contains numerical values to be grouped into bins. Only numerical data types are supported. Binning Mode Determines the method used to compute bin ranges. Choose from the following options: - Sturges – Best for smaller datasets; calculates bins using the Sturges’ formula: k = ⌈log₂(n) + 1⌉ where n is the number of data points. - Freedman Diaconis – Accounts for data variability and is robust to outliers. Bin width is calculated using the interquartile range (IQR). - Scott – Minimizes binning error by selecting optimal bin width based on the standard deviation of the dataset. - Square Root – Uses a simple rule: number of bins = √n . Useful for quick approximations. - Fixed Size Intervals – Manually specify bin width and range. The system will use this size to segment the data evenly. Requires Minimum Value , Maximum Value , and Number Of Bins to be set. - Custom – Manually define specific ranges or thresholds for each bin. Number Of Bins Applicable only for certain modes like Fixed Size Intervals . Defines how many intervals the data should be divided into. Minimum Value Visible only for Fixed Size Intervals . The minimum starting value of the first bin. Values less than this will be excluded or grouped separately. Maximum Value Visible only for Fixed Size Intervals . The maximum value to be covered by the bins. Values exceeding this may be excluded or handled as overflow. Output Column The name of the new column that will contain the bin labels or categories (e.g., Age_Binned ). Include Original Whether to retain the original unbinned numerical column in the output: Enabled – Retain the original column. Disabled – Only include the binned output. Sample Input Age 23 35 47 59 72 89 Sample Configuration Field Value Column Age Binning Mode Fixed Size Intervals Number Of Bins 4 Minimum Value 20 Maximum Value 100 Output Column Age_Binned Include Original Enabled If mode was set to Custom , you would instead define bin thresholds manually, e.g., 0–25 , 25–50 , 50–75 , 75–100 . Sample Output Age Age_Binned 23 20–40 35 20–40 47 40–60 59 40–60 72 60–80 89 80–100"

Applicable to Calculated Columns Expressions Return Value The return value of the DISTINCTCOUNTX function is an integer representing the count of unique, non-duplicate values in the specified column that satisfy the specified condition. Remark DISTINCTCOUNTX is useful when you want to count the number of distinct items in a column or dataset while applying a specific condition or filter. It helps you find out how many unique items meet certain criteria. DISTINCTCOUNTX function can be used across Date, Strings and Numbers. DISTINCTCOUNTX function takes only all values into account. Syntax DISTINCTCOUNTX(<expression>,<condition>) DISTINCTCOUNTX in Board Expression Parameter Description Expression A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the actual widget and measure names. Condition A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the condition filter. Widget Name The specific name or identifier of the widget being used for data visualization in the specific Infoboard. Measure Represents the name of the measure that is being displayed or analyzed using the widget. Dimension Represents the dimension column that is being displayed or analyzed using the widget. Dimension Value Represents the specific dimension items within the dimension column used for the visualization in the widget. Steps to Use DISTINCTCOUNTX Write the DISTINCTCOUNTX function. For instance DISTINCTCOUNTX(<expression>,<condition>) Replace <expression> with 'Widget Name'[Measure] and <condition> with [Dimension Name]=\"Dimension Value\" . Replace Widget Name , Measure , Dimension , and Dimension Value with your actual values. Set the DISTINCTCOUNTX function based on the scenario. To learn how to configure an Expression in Infoveave, visit the section Configure Expression . Scenario You’re managing a dataset and an associated Infoboard named ‘Energy Feed,’ which tracks energy customer data, within your Energy Consumption Analysis System. Your goal is to precisely count the number of unique solar customers who qualify for either the “Pay on Time” or “No Discount” categories, without counting any customer more than once. This is vital for understanding customer segmentation and ensuring accurate data analysis. Scenario Details Dashboard Name Energy Consumption Dashboard Widget Name Power Feed In Measure Name Customers (representing the number of customers) Dimension Name Discount Types (categorizing customers based on their payment behavior) Dimension Values “Pay on Time” (customers who pay their bills on time) and “No Discount” (customers not eligible for any discount) Objective Your objective is to count the number of unique customers who belong to either the “ Pay on Time ” or “ No Discount ” category. If this count equals 0, you want to trigger a specific action on your dashboard. You can use the DISTINCTCOUNTX function like this DISTINCTCOUNTX('Power Feed In'[Customers], [Discount Types] = \"Pay on Time\" AND [Discount Types]=\"No Discount\")=0 DISTINCTCOUNTX in Calculated Columns Parameter Description Expression A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the column names. Condition A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the condition filter. Column Name The name of the column in the dataset or Datasource that contains the values you want to analyze. Filter Condition A filter condition returns the data points that meet the defined condition that you want to analyze. The filter condition can be either a string or a numeric.

    "content": "Split HTTP Query | Infoveave Help Skip to content Split HTTP Query Description The Split HTTP Query activity is used to extract and convert HTTP query strings embedded within URLs into structured, column-based data. This is particularly useful in cases where user input, system requests, or web-tracking data are passed as URL query parameters and stored in a single column. This activity scans each value in the selected column to detect standard query string structures—those typically following a ? in a URL, such as: https://domain.com/resource?key1=value1&key2=value2 Once detected, it parses each parameter (key-value pair) and creates new columns in the dataset, assigning values from the query string accordingly. This enables users to access and manipulate data like id , name , department , etc., as individual fields rather than dealing with them inside an encoded string. Example Use Case : You may have a dataset of employee links where each URL includes parameters like ?id=E003&name=Carlos+Gomez&department=Engineering . This activity will extract E003 , Carlos+Gomez , and Engineering into separate columns named Key_id , Key_name , and Key_department , making the data easier to read, filter, or aggregate. Input Type Description Data A dataset containing a column with HTTP URLs or raw query strings. The column must follow the typical format with key-value pairs separated by & . Output Type Description Transformed Data A dataset where the selected column’s query parameters are expanded into individual columns. Configuration Fields Field Name Description Column Name The column to be parsed. It should contain complete URLs or raw query strings containing key-value pairs separated by & . Only a single column can be selected. Prefix A custom prefix for the newly created columns. Each extracted key will be appended to this prefix. For example, a key id with prefix Key_ becomes Key_id . This is useful to prevent naming collisions or to group similar fields. Include Original Determines whether the original input row is retained. - Enabled : Keeps all the original columns, including the raw HTTP query. - Disabled : Only shows the parsed query parameter columns. Sample Input employee_id name http_query E001 John Doe https://company.com/employee?id=E001&name=John+Doe&department=Sales E002 Marie Dupont https://company.com/employee?id=E002&name=Marie+Dupont&department=Marketing E003 Carlos Gómez https://company.com/employee?id=E003&name=Carlos+Gómez&department=Engineering Sample Configuration Field Value Column Name http_query Prefix Key_ Include Original Enabled Sample Output employee_id name http_query Key_id Key_name Key_department E001 John Doe https://company.com/employee?id=E001&name=John+Doe&department=Sales E001 John+Doe Sales E002 Marie Dupont https://company.com/employee?id=E002&name=Marie+Dupont&department=Marketing E002 Marie+Dupont Marketing E003 Carlos Gómez https://company.com/employee?id=E003&name=Carlos+Gómez&department=Engineering E003 Carlos+Gómez Engineering"

    "content": "Lists | Infoveave Help Skip to content Lists Lists in Infoveave allow you to organize, analyze, and maintain datasets more efficiently. They enable you to generate custom views of your data using SQL queries on any Datasource within Infoveave. You can update, enrich, or selectively modify your data using different ingestion methods. This provides flexibility in managing data without compromising the structure of your queries. Lists make it easier to handle live data, conduct deeper analysis, and share insights in downloadable formats. Using Infoveave , you can create dynamic lists that reflect live data. You can apply selected dimension filters while creating a list to assist in your analysis. These lists can be downloaded for further examination. It is easy to search for and preview any list you need. You can then download it in formats like CSV or Excel. Creating Lists Infoveave Lists allows you to create and manage a list of selected columns generated through SQL Queries on any Datasource within Infoveave. To create a List in Infoveave using any existing Datasource, click on Studio Lists . All lists created by you or shared with you are displayed under the tabs My Lists and Shared Lists respectively. To create a new list, click on New List . Assign a name to the new list. Select the connection. Select the Key column for the list. Write the query. Validate the list by clicking the Validate button. Select the data ingestion type by clicking the appropriate button. Reload This allows the parent query to reload. It truncates and reloads the existing column data in the list. Insert This option lets you select and insert a sub-query for a parent query using the Insert query field. It allows you to insert new columns into the list without altering the parent query. Upsert This option lets you add a sub-query for a parent query using the Upsert query field. You also have to select a key column to insert and update the list without changing the parent query, using the Select key columns field. To save the list you created, click Save . To view the list, click on the View icon. To know more about viewing list, visit Viewing a list The newly created list is now visible under Studio Lists . Scenarios for Data Ingestion Types You are managing a dataset that stores customer information and purchase records for an e-commerce platform. This dataset contains data on customers, their orders, and their purchase history. You need to create a list to analyze this data more effectively. You have the following options for data ingestion. Reload Suppose you have a parent query that retrieves customer data, including contact information and order history. You want to keep this list updated as new orders and customer details are added. By selecting the Reload option, you can refresh the list. When you choose Reload, Infoveave truncates the existing data in your list and replaces it with the most recent data from the parent query. This ensures that your list always reflects the latest customer and order information. This option is especially useful when your Datasource is frequently updated and you want to maintain a real-time or near real-time view of your data. Insert Suppose you want to enhance your list by adding new columns, such as a Total Purchase Amount column that calculates the sum of purchases for each customer. By choosing the Insert option, you can do this without modifying the original parent query. With the Insert option, you create a sub-query that calculates the Total Purchase Amount and inserts it into the list as a new column. This sub-query works independently, allowing you to enrich your list with additional data while keeping the core customer data query unchanged. It gives you the flexibility to customize your list with calculated fields or data from related sources. Upsert Consider a situation where you need to update specific information in your list. For example, some customers have changed their addresses and you want your list to reflect these updates without reloading all the customer data. By selecting Upsert , you can do this efficiently. With Upsert, you define a sub-query that includes the updated customer addresses. You also specify a key column to identify which customer records need to be updated. Infoveave handles the insertion and update of the data in your list, updating only the records that have changed while preserving the rest. This approach helps you maintain data accuracy without changing the parent query structure. Managing Lists To learn more about managing lists, visit Managing Lists . Downloading Lists from Insights Insights Lists in Infoveave gives you easy access to downloadable data lists. You can quickly find and preview the list you want and download it in formats like CSV or Excel. This helps you simplify data retrieval and use the downloaded data for analysis or sharing. Click on the Insights section in the Infoveave menu. In the Insights layout, find the Lists option. Browse through the lists or use the search bar for quick access. After you find the list you want, click on it to open the list details. You are redirected to the List View. In the List View, you can preview the contents of the list including the data and columns. To download the list, click on the Download button."

Click Save to apply the linked View. Hover over the selected widget to view the tooltip. Conditional Expressions Setup Conditional Expressions In Infoboard Infoboard expressions are special rules that help you create dynamic and customized data visualizations by applying conditions to widget measures and dimension values. These expressions let you control how other widgets behave and appear based on conditions, making Infoboards more interactive and visually effective. Expression Syntax Function(<Reference>,<Condition>) = Conditional Value Where <Reference> is written as 'Widget Name'[Measure Name] and <Condition> is written as [Dimension Name] = \"Dimension Value\" Function represents a specific command used in data analysis. 'Widget Name' uses single quotes to identify it as a string literal, typically for a widget name. Measure Name is inside square brackets to show it’s a measure. Dimension Name is inside square brackets to show it’s a dimension. \"Dimension Value\" is inside double quotes to specify a particular value. The operator used in the expression defines the condition and is shown here for demonstration only. Conditional Value represents the value that needs to be true for the condition to apply. Configuring Expressions To set up an expression in Infoveave, go to the desired Infoboard under Insights . Click Configuration under the Infoboard Setup tab for the selected Infoboard. Select Configure expressions . This opens the expression editor. The editor shows any previously created expressions. Click Add Expression to create a new one. Enter your expression using the correct syntax. Define measures, dimensions, filters, calculations, and conditions. Use functions and operators available in Infoveave. After writing the expression, set the Action that should happen when the condition is met. Actions can include changing widget properties, showing messages, or triggering other widget interactions. To add another Action, click the Add rule + icon. You can add up to two actions for one expression. Use the radio button to set the widget’s Visibility . Choose between Show or Hide based on your condition. Assign the action to a specific Option Group. Common groups include General, Title, Measure, and Label . In the General group, you can customize the widget’s appearance such as background color, borders, and shadows. In the Title group, you can change title settings like text, font size, and alignment. In the Image group, you can manage image display including position and size. In the Label group, you control label display options like placement and size. Depending on your selected option group, customize the action. Here’s a breakdown of common action settings: General Background color lets you set the widget’s background. Border allows you to configure the border’s color, width, and style. Border Radius adjusts the corner roundness. Shadow adds shadow effects. Theme lets you apply a visual theme. Decal adds decorative icons or elements. Show null values determines if empty data appears. Title Enabled toggles the title visibility. Label sets the title text. Word wrap allows long text to continue on a new line. Background color sets the background for the title. Decoration adds styling like underline or bold. Font family chooses the font style. Font size defines how large the title text is. Font color sets the title text color. Alignment places the title within the widget. Image Image selects the image to display. Position sets where the image appears. Repeat controls image tiling. Size defines the image dimensions. Click the Delete icon to remove an expression or action. Click Save to save the expression. Scenario You manage an Order Infoboard in Infoveave and want to trigger an action using an Expression. In this example, if the total number of online orders for Brazil is less than 150, a specific action should be triggered. Contextual information Your dataset in the Order Infoboard tracks Online Orders using the [Orders] measure and [Country] dimension, with the value “Brazil” as the focus. Configure Expression Here’s how you define the expression SUMX('Online Orders'[Orders], [Country]=\"Brazil\") < 150 This checks if the sum of online orders in Brazil is below 150. To trigger an action such as changing the background color of the Online Orders widget: Choose the General option group because you’re adjusting the widget’s appearance. From the General options, select Background color to apply a new background color when the condition is met. By choosing the correct option group and action, you define how the widget responds to your condition. Expressions let you control how widgets behave and appear, helping your Infoboard share meaningful insights and highlight important information effectively. Configuring a Color Palette The Infoveave color palette lets you customize the appearance of your data. You can assign specific colors and icons to individual dimensions and measures. This improves readability and ensures consistent visual representation across all widgets in the Infoboard. Follow these steps to configure a color palette. Open the Infoboard where you want to add a color palette and click on the Edit option. Go to the Infoboard Setup tab under the Customize panel to access color palette options. Under the Configuration option, click on the Configure color palette button. This opens a modal where you can define colors and icons for specific dimensions or measures. You can also view existing palettes. Choose the required Datasource from the available list. Select either Dimension or Measure from the Add by options. Pick the dimension or measure for which you want to define a color. Select the specific item to which you want to assign a color and icon. Select the desired icon from the Infoveave icon library. Pick a color using the color picker or enter a color code. Click on the Add button to assign the color and icon to the color palette. Managing Infoboard Layout Infoveave lets you arrange your Infoboard layout for optimal presentation. You can use drag-and-drop to move and resize widgets for desktop, tablet, or smartphone views. To manage your Infoboard layout Go to the Insights module. Choose the Infoboard whose layout you want to update. Click the Edit icon to enter editing mode. In the editing view, find layout settings under the Infoboard Setup tab in the View section. Select the layout type you need. Choose between Desktop, Mobile, or Print.

Each unique value from the original column becomes a separate column, where: 1 indicates that the value was present in the original field for that row. 0 indicates absence. This is useful when you have multi-tag fields (e.g., “red, blue, green”) and need to perform one-hot encoding or binary expansion. If the separator is left empty, each character is treated as a separate value. Example : Given a column named Tags with values like \"A, B, C\" and \"A, C\" , this activity creates new columns Tags_A , Tags_B , and Tags_C , and marks them with 1 or 0 based on whether that tag was present. Input Data – Required Requires tabular structured input with at least one column containing delimited string values. Output Output Type Format Description Data Tabular Input with binary columns replacing the original tag column.

URLs often store critical information like identifiers, categories, or navigation paths, and this activity enables structured access to that data for analysis, filtering, or transformation. By specifying the source column containing URLs and configuring the output column names for different components, users can efficiently extract web-related metadata for use in dashboards, reports, or downstream processing. Example Use Case : A dataset contains URLs accessed by users: https://company.com:8080/employee?id=E001&name=John+Doe#profile This activity will split it into: Protocol: https Host: company.com Port: 8080 Path: /employee Query: id=E001&name=John+Doe Fragment: profile Input Type Description Data Only A column in the dataset must contain full URLs (including schemes like http, https, ftp, etc.) Output Type Description Transformed Data Adds new columns for the extracted components of the URL (e.g., protocol, host, path, query, etc.) Configuration Fields Field Name Description URL Column Specifies the column containing the full URLs to be parsed.

    "content": "Introducing Targets and Thresholds | Infoveave Help Skip to content Introducing Targets and Thresholds In Infoveave, Targets and Thresholds help you define significant points in your data and notify you when a measure reaches a specific level. A Target enables you to visualize the difference between the desired score and the actual measure of an indicator on a certain date. Thresholds define a normal range of measures for an indicator and alert you when specific events occur, such as when a measure reaches an all-time high or low. Creating Targets and Thresholds To create and set up a Target and Threshold based on your available Datasource, click on Automation Target and Thresholds . All Targets and Thresholds created by you or shared with you are displayed under the tabs My Targets and Thresholds and Shared Targets and Thresholds respectively. To define a new formula, click on New Target and Threshold . Enter the Target and Threshold Name . Selecting Datasource, Measures & Dimensions Select the Datasource, associated measures, and dimensions for your Target and Threshold. This helps you align the Alerts with your requirements. Select the Datasource you want to use from the drop-down list. Select the required Measures and Dimensions from their respective lists. Select the alert frequency for the date dimension. You can choose from years, quarters, months, weeks, or days. After configuring all measures and dimensions, define their aggregation type as either sum or average. Click on Save to save the Target and Threshold configuration. By default, Infoveave creates four alerts for each Target and Threshold. Click on the alert icon of the Target and Threshold to view these alerts. You need to configure these alerts with the correct target and threshold levels so they can be triggered. To do this, you must provide values for each target and threshold based on the defined frequency and dimension values using the provided template. Downloading the Target and Threshold Template The Target and Threshold template provides a framework for setting the target and threshold values. After downloading the template, you can define your target and threshold values before uploading them back into Infoveave. You can select the required frequency and dimension values while downloading. To define the target and threshold values, start by downloading the template. Click on the Download icon for the required Target and Threshold under Automation Target and Thresholds . The download template dialog box appears showing the selected dimension values. Select the date range based on the frequency you want. Choose between Percentage or Value of the target based on the type of value you want to insert in the template. Select the dimension items for each dimension on which you want to apply the targets and thresholds. If you want to select all available dimension values, use the Select All option. Click on the Download button to download the template in .csv format. Open the downloaded template and define the targets and three threshold values as required. Ideally, the threshold values must be represented as “Below,” “Average,” and “Above,” corresponding to Threshold1, Threshold2, and Threshold3. However, you can define them as required for your business scenario. Uploading the Target and Threshold Template Uploading the Target and Threshold template into Infoveave allows you to apply the configured targets and thresholds. Click on the Upload Template icon to begin. The upload template dialog box appears for you to upload the configured template. Browse your local storage and select the template file you created earlier. Confirm the upload by clicking on the Data Upload button. You receive a success notification once the template is uploaded. To verify the uploaded template and ensure it accurately reflects your target and threshold values, click on the Edit Target and Threshold option.

    "content": "Block Matrix | Infoveave Help Skip to content Block Matrix The Block Matrix Chart is a powerful matrix-style scatter visualization that compares two categorical dimensions arranged along the X-axis and Y-axis . Each intersection point on this grid is represented by a symbol (typically a circle or square), with its size indicating the magnitude of a numerical measure . Unlike traditional heatmaps that rely solely on color shading, Block Matrix Charts provide an intuitive and visually rich way to identify patterns by encoding values through symbol size. Optional color gradients via heatmap scaling can also be applied to further highlight variations in data. This chart type is particularly useful when analyzing the relationships and distribution between two categorical variables alongside a quantitative metric — with a required group dimension for creating multiple series within the matrix. Use cases: Comparing sales revenue across regions (X-axis) and product categories (Y-axis) segmented by sales channel (Group) . Visualizing error counts by error type , application module , and environment (Group) . Mapping survey response distributions across multiple demographics and response options. Reviewing stock levels across warehouses and product SKUs , grouped by supply source . ⚙️ Setup Drag the Block Matrix Chart widget from the chart library onto your designer workspace. Select the chart. Go to the Widget Configuration tab in the Customize panel. Under the Configuration tab, select the Basic Configuration option to access the essential settings for the block matrix chart. Select the Source which the chart will pull the data from the option.

It allows workflows to open a URL , interact with input fields , click buttons , extract text , wait for events , run custom scripts , and more—all within a defined sequence of actions. This activity is ideal for browser automation , UI-based scraping , or integrating with third-party apps that lack APIs. Use case : In a price-monitoring workflow, use this activity to navigate to an eCommerce site, input a product name, extract its price, and take a screenshot. The result can be logged, analyzed, or emailed via a downstream activity. Input Data – Optional Output Output Type Format Description Data JSON Result of executed browser actions, including screenshots and logs Configuration Fields Field Name Description Start URL The initial URL to launch in the browser for automation (e.g., https://example.com/login ). Browser Web browser to use. Options: Chrome , Firefox . Key Column Maps a unique identifier from the input data to each execution cycle. Helps track outputs row-wise. Args Optional input arguments from previous activity to dynamically control actions (e.g., user credentials, search terms). Actions A sequenced list of browser-based tasks to perform. See details in the next section. Action Types & Selector Syntax Each action supports configuration of its selector and parameters . Selector Basics Most actions use a selector to identify the target HTML element. Selectors must follow CSS Selector conventions. To get the selector of an element on a webpage, right-click the element in your browser, choose “Inspect”, then in the Developer Tools panel, right-click the highlighted HTML and choose “Copy → Copy selector”. This gives a unique CSS selector you can use in automation. Selector Type Example Description ID #username Matches element with ID username . Class .login-button Matches any element with class login-button . Tag input Matches all <input> elements. Attribute input[name='email'] Matches input element with name=\"email\" . Hierarchy div.form-group > input[type=text] Matches child input inside div.form-group . Multiple ul > li:nth-child(2) Matches the second list item. Supported Actions Action Type Description Click Simulates a click on an element ( selector required). Input Text Enters text into an input field ( selector and text required). Wait Waits for a fixed number of milliseconds ( duration field required). Script Executes a custom JavaScript snippet in the browser context. Select Field Selects a field (typically for focus or validation). Extract Text Extracts visible text from a target element ( selector required). Fill Similar to Input Text but used for full form population ( selector , value ). Dynamic Text Inserts dynamic text based on input data or variables. Drag And Drop Drags one element and drops it on another ( sourceSelector , targetSelector ). Dropdown Opens a dropdown element ( selector ) and selects an option. Find Selector Locates the presence of an element in the DOM ( selector ). Focus Moves browser focus to a specific element. Screenshot Captures a screenshot at the current step of the browser window or page section. Hover Simulates a mouse hover over an element.

    "content": "Workflow Start | Infoveave Help Skip to content Workflow Start A Workflow is a sequence of activities that are linked together to automate business-critical tasks such as data acquisition, analysis, and reporting. You can execute a Workflow instantly or schedule it for execution. You can also view the status or execution history of an executing Workflow. The Workflow Start functionality enables you to set up triggers for initiating Workflows. Infoveave provides four types of Workflow start triggers, each serving a different purpose. Workflow Start trigger This trigger allows you to start the Workflow manually. It gives you the flexibility to initiate the Workflow whenever you find it necessary, providing manual control over the process. You can upload files or JSON data that might be required for your Workflow activity. Cron trigger The Cron trigger enables you to schedule the Workflow to run at specific intervals using CRON expressions. This trigger is useful for automating repetitive activities that need to occur at regular intervals such as daily, weekly, or monthly reports. Webhook trigger With the Webhook trigger, Workflows can be triggered by HTTP requests sent from external systems. This allows seamless integration with other applications and systems, enabling Workflows to be initiated based on external events or data changes. Emailhook trigger The Emailhook trigger initiates the Workflow based on incoming emails. You can set up rules to trigger the Workflow when specific emails are received. This allows for automated processing of email-based activities or notifications. Each trigger type in Infoveave offers unique advantages. You can select them based on your specific Workflow requirements and integration needs. Workflow Start trigger The Workflow Start trigger allows you to start the Workflow manually through an interface. You can upload an array of JSON data or multiple files to initiate a Workflow. This functionality allows you to manually input data or upload files that contain the necessary information to start the Workflow process. Workflow Start triggers are ideal for Workflows that need to be initiated on demand. To set up the Workflow Start trigger, follow the steps below. Select the Workflow Start trigger icon. Enter the raw data in JSON format in the data field. To upload a file, click on the Attach files button and select the required file. Click on the upload icon to upload the attached file or JSON data for execution. Click on the Validate button to validate the data and all the uploads. The raw data entered will be showcased as Data after validation. The file uploaded will be showcased as Files after validation.

You can schedule the Workflow based on the day and time. Infoveave allows options such as Days of the Week Days of the Month Months To schedule Workflow automation using the Cron trigger, follow the steps below. Select the Cron trigger icon in the Workflow start. Select the desired frequency for Workflow execution. Choose Every if you want to schedule the Workflow after a fixed time interval such as every 2 hours. Select the appropriate interval value between 1 and 23 hours or 1 and 59 minutes. Choose On if you want to schedule the Workflow only at specific times in a day such as 10 AM and 6 PM. Select the desired hour value between 1 and 23 or minute value between 1 and 59. Choose At if you want to schedule the Workflow at a specific time such as 6:30. Select the desired hour and minute from the drop-down lists. Choose Custom if you want to schedule the Workflow at a custom time. Select the time zone from the drop-down list. Choose the days on which you want to execute the Workflow. By default, Infoveave sets it to every day. You can select specific days of the week, days of the month, or months. Click on the Add button to set the schedule for Workflow execution. The scheduled times will be displayed in a tabular form. To Delete a scheduled time, click on the delete icon associated with that schedule. Webhook trigger The Webhook trigger allows Workflows to be triggered by HTTP requests sent from external systems. This trigger enables seamless integration with other applications and systems. It allows Workflows to be initiated based on external events or data changes. You can configure the Webhook trigger to listen for specific HTTP requests and trigger the Workflow accordingly. This trigger is useful for building automated Workflows that respond to external events such as data updates or notifications from other systems. To trigger Workflow automation using the Webhook, follow the steps below. Select the Webhook trigger icon in the Workflow start. Click on the Add button to start adding the Webhook trigger. Enter a Name for the Webhook. Define the URL Endpoint in the URL string. Click on the Save icon to save the configuration. Mouse over the added URL to get the full URL. This will be used for the HTTP post request for the external trigger. Emailhook trigger The Emailhook trigger initiates the Workflow based on incoming emails. You can set up specific email addresses.

Select Configure expressions . This opens the expression editor. The editor shows any previously created expressions. Click Add Expression to create a new one. Enter your expression using the correct syntax. Define measures, dimensions, filters, calculations, and conditions. Use functions and operators available in Infoveave. After writing the expression, set the Action that should happen when the condition is met. Actions can include changing widget properties, showing messages, or triggering other widget interactions. To add another Action, click the Add rule + icon. You can add up to two actions for one expression. Use the radio button to set the widget’s Visibility . Choose between Show or Hide based on your condition. Assign the action to a specific Option Group. Common groups include General, Title, Measure, and Label . In the General group, you can customize the widget’s appearance such as background color, borders, and shadows. In the Title group, you can change title settings like text, font size, and alignment. In the Image group, you can manage image display including position and size. In the Label group, you control label display options like placement and size. Depending on your selected option group, customize the action. Here’s a breakdown of common action settings: General Background color lets you set the widget’s background. Border allows you to configure the border’s color, width, and style. Border Radius adjusts the corner roundness. Shadow adds shadow effects. Theme lets you apply a visual theme. Decal adds decorative icons or elements. Show null values determines if empty data appears. Title Enabled toggles the title visibility. Label sets the title text. Word wrap allows long text to continue on a new line. Background color sets the background for the title. Decoration adds styling like underline or bold. Font family chooses the font style. Font size defines how large the title text is. Font color sets the title text color. Alignment places the title within the widget. Image Image selects the image to display. Position sets where the image appears. Repeat controls image tiling. Size defines the image dimensions. Click the Delete icon to remove an expression or action. Click Save to save the expression. Scenario You manage an Order Infoboard in Infoveave and want to trigger an action using an Expression. In this example, if the total number of online orders for Brazil is less than 150, a specific action should be triggered. Contextual information Your dataset in the Order Infoboard tracks Online Orders using the [Orders] measure and [Country] dimension, with the value “Brazil” as the focus. Configure Expression Here’s how you define the expression SUMX('Online Orders'[Orders], [Country]=\"Brazil\") < 150 This checks if the sum of online orders in Brazil is below 150. To trigger an action such as changing the background color of the Online Orders widget: Choose the General option group because you’re adjusting the widget’s appearance. From the General options, select Background color to apply a new background color when the condition is met. By choosing the correct option group and action, you define how the widget responds to your condition. Expressions let you control how widgets behave and appear, helping your Infoboard share meaningful insights and highlight important information effectively.

    "content": "SWITCH | Infoveave Help Skip to content SWITCH The SWITCH function in Infoveave evaluates a condition against an expression and returns a value if the condition is true. Applicable to Calculated Columns Return Value The SWITCH function returns the specified value if the condition is true. Remark The SWITCH function can be used as a more concise alternative to IF statements for simple conditional logic. Syntax SWITCH(<expression>, condition, value) SWITCH in Calculated Columns Parameter Description Expression A placeholder in a function that is replaced with the column names. Condition The condition to evaluate against the expression. Value The value to return if the condition is true. Write the SWITCH function. For instance SWITCH(<expression>, condition, value) Replace <expression> with VALUE([Column Name]), replace condition with the actual case that you want to evaluate against expression and replace value with what you expect to return when the condition turns true.Replace the Column Name with the actual name of your column required. To learn how to add calculated columns in Infoveave, visit the section Calculated Columns . Example 1 Objective Consider you want to create a pricing bucket to categorize the unit price on the below table. ORDER DATE COUNTRY CATEGORY UNIT PRICE MARKET PRICE QUANTITY 2024-01-03 Brazil Baby Food 38.41 43.7874 2 2024-01-07 Japan Spices 45.56 50.8155 20 Japan 43.7874 10 2024-01-18 32.3019 4 2024-01-22 Brazil Cosmetics 28.335 23.0109 7 2024-01-26 Canada 20.185 23.0109 9 2024-01-04 France Cereal 25.26 28.7964 9 2024-01-09 Brazil Cereal 44.575 50.8155 8 2024-01-14 Brazil Snacks 20.185 4 Brazil Cosmetics 40.485 46.1529 2 You can use the SWITCH function like SWITCH(TRUE, VALUE([UNIT PRICE]) > 40, \"High Price\", VALUE([UNIT PRICE]) < 40 AND VALUE([UNIT PRICE]) > 30  , \"Medium Price\", \"Low Price\") The new calculated column “Price Bucket” will return ORDER DATE COUNTRY CATEGORY UNIT PRICE MARKET PRICE QUANTITY PRICE BUCKET 03-01-2024 Brazil Baby Food 38.41 43.7874 2 Medium Price 07-01-2024 Japan Spices 45.56 50.8155 20 High Price Japan 43.7874 10 Low Price 18-01-2024 32.3019 4 Low Price 22-01-2024 Brazil Cosmetics 28.335 23.0109 7 Low Price 26-01-2024 Canada 20.185 23.0109 9 Low Price 04-01-2024 France Cereal 25.26 28.7964 9 Low Price 09-01-2024 Brazil Cereal 44.575 50.8155 8 High Price 14-01-2024 Brazil Snacks 20.185 4 Low Price Brazil Cosmetics 40.485 46.1529 2 High Price Example 2 The SWITCH function in Infoveave can also transform values based on specified conditions. For example SWITCH(VALUE([COUNTRY]), \"Brazil\", \"BR\", \"Japan\", \"JP\", \"Canada\", \"CA\", \"FRANCE\", \"FR\") The SWITCH function converts the country names into their respective country codes. For example, if the original value from [COUNTRY] is “Brazil”, the SWITCH function will return “BR”. Similarly, “Japan” will be converted to “JP”, “Canada” to “CA”, and “France” to “FR”. If the value from [COUNTRY] does not match any of the specified conditions, the SWITCH function will return NULL."
